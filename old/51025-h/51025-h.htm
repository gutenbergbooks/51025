<h2><a name="THE_HOUSE_OF_REPRESENTATIVES_ITS" id="THE_HOUSE_OF_REPRESENTATIVES_ITS"></a>THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: ITS
PROPER NUMBER.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on the Bill for the Apportionment
of Representatives among the States, January
29, 1872.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Before the vote is taken I
desire to make one remark. I was struck with
the suggestion of the Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>],
the other day, with regard to the proposition
which comes from the House. He reminded us that
it was a House proposition, and that it was natural
that the House should be allowed to regulate itself.
I think there is much in that worthy of consideration.
I doubt if the Senate would receive with much
favor any proposition from the House especially applicable
to us. I think we should be disposed to repel
it. I think we should say that our experience
should enable us to judge that question better than
the experience of the House. And now I ask whether
the experience of the House does not enable them
to judge of the question of numbers better than we can
judge of it? On general grounds I confess I should
myself prefer a smaller House; personally I incline
that way; but I am not willing on that point to set
myself against the House.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, Sir, I cannot be insensible to the experience of
other countries. I do not know whether Senators have
troubled themselves on that head; but if they have not,
I think it will not be uninteresting to them to have
their attention called to the numbers of the great legislative
bodies of the world at this moment. For instance,
beginning with England, there is the upper
House, the Chamber of Peers, composed of four hundred
and sixty-six members; then the lower House,
the House of Commons, with six hundred and fifty-eight
members. We know that, practically, these members
attend only in comparatively small numbers; that
it is only on great questions that either House is full.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Trumbull.</span> Did the House of Lords ever have anything
like that number present?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It has had several hundred. There are
four hundred and sixty-six entitled to seats in the House
of Lords.</p>

<p>Pass over to France. The National Assembly, sitting
at Versailles at this moment, elected February 8
and July 2, 1871, consists of seven hundred and thirty-eight
members.</p>

<p>Pass on to Prussia. The upper Chamber of the Parliament
of Prussia has two hundred and sixty-seven members;
the lower Chamber has four hundred and thirty-two.
Now we all know that Prussia is a country where
no rule of administration or of constitution is adopted
lightly, and everything is considered, if I may so express
myself, in the light of science.</p>

<p>Pass to Austria, under the recent organization. You
are aware that there are two different Parliaments now
in Austria,&mdash;one for what is called the cis-Leithan territories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
territories this side of the river Leitha; the other,
trans-Leithan, or those on the other side, being the Hungarian
territory. Beginning with those on this side of
the river, the upper House consists of one hundred and
seventy-five members: observe, it is more than twice as
large as our Senate. The lower House consists of two
hundred and three members: smaller than our House
of Representatives. But now pass to the other side of
the river and look at the Hungarian Parliament. There
the upper House contains two hundred and sixty-six
members, and the lower House, or Chamber of Deputies,
as it is called, four hundred and thirty-eight.</p>

<p>Pass to Italy, a country organized under a new constitution
in the light of European and American experience,
liberal, and with a disposition to found its
institutions on the basis of science. The Senate of
Italy contains two hundred and seventy members, the
Chamber of Deputies five hundred and eight.</p>

<p>Then pass to Spain. There the upper branch of the
Cortes contains one hundred and ninety-six members,
and the lower branch four hundred and sixteen.</p>

<p>So that you will find in all these countries,&mdash;Great
Britain, France, Prussia, Austria in its two Parliaments,
Italy, and Spain,&mdash;that the number adopted for
the lower House is much larger than any now proposed
for our House of Representatives.</p>

<p>I call attention to this fact because it illustrates by
the experience of other nations what may be considered
as a rule on this subject. At any rate, it shows that
other nations are not deterred by anything in political
experience from having a House with these large numbers;
and this perhaps is of more value because European
writers, political philosophers for successive generations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
have warred against large bodies. We have the
famous saying of the Cardinal de Retz, that any body
of men above a hundred is a mob; and that saying,
coming from so consummate a statesman and wit, has
passed into a proverb, doubtless affecting the judgment of
many minds; and yet in the face of this testimony, and
with the writings of political philosophers all inclining
against numbers, we find that the actual practical experience
of Europe has gone the other way. The popular
branch in all these considerable countries is much
more numerous than it is now proposed to make our
House of Representatives.</p>

<h2><a name="REFORM_AND_PURITY_IN_GOVERNMENT" id="REFORM_AND_PURITY_IN_GOVERNMENT"></a>REFORM AND PURITY IN GOVERNMENT:
NEUTRAL DUTIES. SALE OF ARMS TO
BELLIGERENT FRANCE.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, February 28, 1872.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 12, 1872, Mr. Sumner introduced a resolution, with a
preamble setting forth its grounds, providing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That a select committee of seven be appointed to investigate all sales
of ordnance stores made by the Government of the United States during
the war between France and Germany; to ascertain the persons to whom
such sales were made, the circumstances under which they were made, and
the real parties in interest, and the sums respectively paid and received
by the real parties; and that the committee have power to send for persons
and papers; and that the investigation be conducted in public.”</p>

</div>

<p>And on his motion it was ordered to lie on the table and be printed.</p>

<p>On the 14th the resolution was taken up for consideration, when
Mr. Sumner entered into an exposition of the matter referred to in
the preamble, and of the law applicable thereto, remarking in conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the first time has the United States, within my knowledge, fallen
under suspicion of violating the requirement of neutrality on this subject.
Such seems to be our present position. We are under suspicion. What I
propose is a searching inquiry, according to the magnitude of the interests
involved, to ascertain if this is without just grounds.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thereupon ensued a long and acrimonious debate,&mdash;toward the
close of which, Mr. Sumner, on the 28th, in review of the case, spoke
as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">MR PRESIDENT,&mdash;Besides the unaccustomed interest
which this debate excites, I cannot fail to
note that it has wandered far beyond any purpose of
mine, and into fields where I have no desire to follow.
In a few plain remarks I shall try to bring it back to
the real issue, which I hope to present without passion
or prejudice. I declare only the rule of my life, when
I say that nothing shall fall from me to-day which is not
prompted by the love of truth and the desire for justice;
but you will pardon me, if I remember that there is
something on this planet higher than the Senate or any
Senator, higher than any public functionary, higher than
any political party: it is the good name of the American
people and the purity of Government, which must
be saved from scandal. In this spirit and with this aspiration
I shall speak to-day.</p>

<p>In considering this resolution we must not forget the
peculiar demands of the present moment. An aroused
community in the commercial metropolis of our country
has unexpectedly succeeded in overthrowing a corrupt
ring by which millions of money had been sacrificed.
Tammany has been vanquished. Here good Democrats
vied with Republicans. The country was thrilled by
the triumph, and insisted that it should be extended.
Then came manifestations against abuses of the civil
service generally, and especially in that other Tammany,
the New York custom-house. The call for investigation
at last prevailed in this Chamber, and the newspapers
have been burdened since with odious details. Everybody
says there must be reform, so that the Government
in all its branches shall be above suspicion. The
cry for reform is everywhere,&mdash;from New York to New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Orleans. Within a few days we hear of a great meeting,
amounting to ten thousand, in the latter city, without
distinction of party, calling for reform; and the demand
is echoed from place to place. Reform is becoming a
universal watchword.</p>

<p>In harmony with this cry is the appointment of a
Civil-Service Commission, which has proposed mild
measures looking to purity and independence in office-holders.</p>

<p>Amidst these transactions, occupying the attention of
the country, certain facts are reported, tending to show
abuses in the sale of arms at the Ordnance Office, exciting
at least suspicion in that quarter; and this is aggravated
by a seeming violation of neutral duties at a critical
moment, when, on various grounds, the nation was
bound to peculiar care. It appeared as if our neutral
duties were sacrificed to money-making, if not to official
jobbers. The injunction of Iago seemed to be
obeyed: “Put money in thy purse.” These things were
already known in Europe, especially through a notorious
trial,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and then by a legislative inquiry, so as to become
a public scandal. It was time that something should be
done to remove the suspicion. This could be only by
a searching investigation in such way as to satisfy all at
home and abroad that there was no whitewashing.</p>

<p>In proportion to the magnitude of the question and
the great interests involved, whether of money or neutral
duty, was the corresponding responsibility on our
part. Here was a case for action without delay.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I brought forward the present
motion. Here I acted in entire harmony with that
movement, now so much applauded, which overthrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Tammany, and that other movement which has exposed
the Custom-House. Its object was inquiry into the sale
of arms. This was the objective point. But much of
this debate has turned on points merely formal, if not
entirely irrelevant.</p>

<p>More than once it has been asserted that I am introducing
“politics”; and then we have been reminded of
the Presidential election, which to certain Senators is a
universal prompter. I asked for reform, and the Senator
from Indiana [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morton</span>], seizing the party bugle,
sounded “To arms!” But I am not tempted to follow
him. I have nothing to say of the President or of the
Presidential election. The Senator cannot make me
depart from the rule I have laid down for myself. I
introduce no “politics,” but only a question which
has become urgent, affecting the civil service of the
country.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I have been from the beginning in favor of
civil-service reform. I am the author of the first bill
on that subject ever introduced into Congress, as long
ago as the spring of 1864.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I am for a real reform that
shall reach the highest as well as the lowest, and I know
no better way to accomplish this beneficent result than
by striving at all times for purity in the administration
of Government. Therefore, when officials fall under suspicion,
I should feel myself disloyal to the Government,
if I did not insist on the most thorough inquiry. So
I have voted in the past, so I must vote in the future.
Call you this politics? Not in the ordinary sense of
the term. It is only honesty and a just regard for the
public weal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it has been said that I am a French agent, and
even a Prussian agent,&mdash;two in one. Sir, I am nothing
but a Senator, whose attention was first called to this
matter by a distinguished citizen not named in this debate.
Since then I have obtained such information with
regard to it as was open to me,&mdash;all going to develop
a case for inquiry.</p>

<p>I should say nothing more in reply to this allegation
but for the vindictive personal assault made upon a valued
friend, the Marquis de Chambrun. The Senator from
Missouri [Mr. <span class="smcap">Schurz</span>] has already spoken for him; but
I claim this privilege also. Besides his own merits,
this gentleman is commended to Americans by his association
with the two French names most cherished
in our country, Lafayette and De Tocqueville. I have
known him from the very day of his arrival in Washington
early in the spring of 1865, and have seen him since,
in unbroken friendship, almost daily. Shortly after his
arrival I took him with me on a visit to Mr. Lincoln at
the front, close upon the capture of Richmond. This
stranger began his remarkable intimacy with American
life by several days in the society of the President only
one week before his death. He was by the side of the
President in his last visit to a military hospital, and
when he last shook hands with the soldiers; also when
he made his last speech from the window of the Executive
Mansion, the stranger was his guest, standing by
his side. From that time down to this day of accusation
his intimacies have extended beyond those of any other
foreigner. His studies of our institutions have been
minute and critical, being second only to those of his
late friend De Tocqueville. Whether conversing on his
own country or on ours, he is always at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>If at any time the Marquis de Chambrun sustained
official relations with the French Government, or was
its agent, he never spoke of it to me; nor did I ever
know it until the papers produced by the Senator from
Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harlan</span>]. Our conversation was always that
of friends, and on topics of general interest, not of business.
Though ignorant of any official relations with his
own Government, I could not fail to know his close relations
with members of our Government, ending in his
recent employment to present our case in French for the
Geneva tribunal,&mdash;an honorable and confidential service,
faithfully performed.</p>

<p>The Senator from Indiana knew of the arms question
some five months before the meeting of Congress. I did
not. It was after the session began, and just before
the holidays, that I first knew of it. And here my informant
was not a foreigner, but, as I have already
said, a distinguished citizen. The French “spy,” as he
is so happily called, though with me daily, never spoke
of it; nor did I speak of it to him. By-and-by the Senator
from Missouri mentioned it, and then, in my desire
to know the evidence affecting persons here, if any such
existed, I spoke to my French friend. This was only a
few days before the resolution.</p>

<p>Such is the history of my relations with the accused.
There is nothing to disguise, nothing that I should not
do again. I know no rule of senatorial duty or of patriotism
which can prevent me from obtaining information
of any kind from any body, especially when the object
is to pursue fraud and to unmask abuse. Is not
a French gentleman a competent witness? Once the
black could not testify against the white, and now in
some places the testimony of a Chinese is rejected. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
I tolerate no such exclusion. Let me welcome knowledge
always, and from every quarter. “Hail, holy
light!”&mdash;no matter from what star or what nation it
may shine.</p>

<p>And this gentleman, fresh from a confidential service
to our own Government, enjoying numerous intimacies
with American citizens, associated with illustrious
names in history and literature, and immediately connected
with one of the highest functionaries of the present
French Government, M. de Rémusat, Minister for
Foreign Affairs, is insulted here as an “emissary” and a
“spy”; nay, more, France is insulted,&mdash;for these terms
are applied only to the secret agents of an enemy in
time of war. But enough. To such madness of error
and vindictive accusation is this defence carried!</p>

<p>Another charge is that I am making a case for Prussia
against our own country. Oh, no! I am making a
case for nobody. I simply try to relieve my country
from an odious suspicion, and to advance the cause of
good government. The Senator from Indiana supposes
that this effort of mine, having such objects, may prejudice
the Emperor of Germany against us in the arbitration
of the San Juan question. The Senator does not
pay a lofty compliment to that enlightened and victorious
ruler. Nay, Sir, the very suggestion of the Senator
is an insult to him, which he is too just to resent, but
which cannot fail to excite a smile of derision. Surely
the Senator was not in earnest.</p>

<p>The jest of the Senator, offered for argument, seems
to forget that all these things are notorious in Europe,
through the active press of Paris and London. Why,
Sir, our own State Department furnishes official evidence
that the alleged sale of arms to the French by our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Government is known in Berlin itself, right under the
eyes of the Emperor. Our Minister there, Mr. Bancroft,
in his dispatch of January 7, 1871, furnishes the
following testimony from the London “Times”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During the Crimean War, arms and munitions of war had
been freely exported from Prussia to Russia; and recently
rifled cannon and ammunition have been furnished to the
French in enormous quantities, <i>not only by private American
traders, but by the War Department at Washington</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These latter words are italicized in the official publication
of our Government, and thus blazoned to the
world. I do not adduce them to show that the War
Department did sell arms to belligerent France, but
that even in Berlin the imputation upon us was known
and actually reported by our Minister. If the latter
made any observations on this imputation I know not;
for at this point in his dispatch are those convenient
asterisks which are the substitute for inconvenient
revelations.</p>

<p>In the same spirit with the last triviality, but in the
anxiety to clutch at something, it is said that the Alabama
Claims are endangered by this inquiry. Very
well, Sir. On this point I am clear. If these historic
claims, so interesting to the American people, are to be
pressed at the cost of purity in our own Government,
they are not worth the terrible price. Better give them
up at once. Let them all go, every dollar. “First pure,
then peaceable”;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> above all things purity. Sir, I have
from the beginning insisted that England should be held
to just account for her violation of international duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
toward us. Is that any reason why I should not also
insist upon inquiry into the conduct of officials at home,
to the end that the Government may be saved from reproach?
Surely we shall be stronger, infinitely stronger,
in demanding our own rights, if we show a determination
to allow no wrong among ourselves. Our example
must not be quoted against us at any time. Especially
must it not be allowed to harden into precedent. But
this can be prevented only by prompt correction, so that
it shall be without authority. Therefore, because I
would have my country irresistible in its demands, do
I insist that it shall place itself above all suspicion.</p>

<p>The objection of Senators is too much like the old
heathen cry, “Our country, right or wrong.” Unhappy
words, which dethrone God and exalt the Devil! I am
for our country with the aspiration that it may be always
right; but I am for nothing wrong. When I hear
of wrong, I insist at all hazards that it shall be made
right, knowing that in this way I best serve my country
and every just cause.</p>

<p>This same objection assumes another form, equally
groundless, when it is said that I reflect upon our country
and hurt its good name. Oh, no! They reflect
upon our country and hurt its good name who at the
first breath of suspicion fail to act. Our good name is
not to be preserved by covering up anything. Not in
secrecy, but in daylight, must we live. What sort of
good name is that which has a cloud gathering about it?
Our duty is to dispel the cloud. Especially is this the
duty of the Senate. Here at least must be that honest
independence which shall insist at all times upon purity
in the Government, no matter what office-holders
are exposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Again it is said that our good name cannot be compromised
by these suspicions. This is a mistake. Any
suspicion of wrong is a compromise, all the more serious
when it concerns not only money, but the violation of
neutral obligations. And the actual fact is precisely
according to reason. Now while we debate, the national
character is compromised at Paris, at London, at Berlin,
at Geneva, where all these things are known as much as
in this Chamber. But your indifference, especially after
this debate, will not tend to elevate the national character
either at home or abroad.</p>

<p>Such are some of the objections to which I reply.
They are words only, as Hamlet says, “Words, words,
words.” From words let us pass to things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, I come now to the simple question before
the Senate, which I presented originally, whether
there is not sufficient reason for inquiry into the sale of
arms during the French and German War. I state the
question thus broadly. The inquiry is into the sale of
arms; and this opens two questions,&mdash;first, of international
duty; and, secondly, of misfeasance in our officials,
the latter involving what may be compendiously
called the money question.</p>

<p>My object is simply to show grounds for inquiry; and
I naturally begin with the rule of international duty.</p>

<p>In the discharge of neutral obligations a nation is
bound to <i>good faith</i>. This is the supreme rule, to which
all else is subordinate. This is the starting-point of all
that is done. Without good faith neutral obligations
must fail. In proportion to the character of this requirement
must be the completeness of its observance.
There can be no evasion, not a jot. Any evasion is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
breach, without the bravery of open violation. But evasion
may be sometimes by closing the eyes to existing
facts, or even by acting without sufficient inquiry.
These things are so plain and entirely reasonable as
to be self-evident.</p>

<p>Now nothing can be more clear than that no neutral
nation is permitted to furnish arms and war material to
a belligerent power. Such is a simple statement of the
law. I do not cite authorities, as I did it amply on a
former occasion.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But there is an excellent author whom I would add
to the list as worthy of consideration, especially at this
moment, in view of the loose pretensions put forth in
the debate. I refer to Mr. Manning, who, in his Commentaries,
thus teaches neutral duty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is no interference with the right of a third party to
say that he shall not carry to my enemy instruments with
which I am to be attacked. Such commerce is, on the other
hand, a deviation from neutrality,&mdash;or rather would be so,
<i>if it were the act of a State</i> and not of individuals.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The distinction is obvious between what can be done
by the individual and what can be done by the State.
The individual may play the merchant and take the
risk of capture; but the State cannot play the merchant
in dealing with a belligerent. Of course, if the foreign
power is at peace, there is no question; but when the
power has become belligerent, then it is excluded from
the market. So far as that power is concerned, all sales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
must be suspended. The interdict is peremptory and absolute.
In such a case there can be no sale knowingly
without mixing in the war,&mdash;precisely as France mixed
in the war of our Revolution in those muskets sent by
the witty Beaumarchais, which England resented by
open war.</p>

<p>And this undoubted principle of International Law
was recognized by the Secretary of War, when he directed
the Chief of Ordnance not to entertain any bids
from E. Remington &amp; Sons, who had stated that they
were agents of the French Government. In giving these
orders he only followed the rule of duty on which the
country can stand without question or reproach; but it
remains to be seen whether persons under him did not
content themselves with obeying the order in letter only,
breaking it in spirit. I assume that the order was given
in good faith. Was it obeyed in good faith? Here we
start with the admitted postulate that it was wrong to
sell arms to France.</p>

<p>But if this cannot be done directly, it is idle to say
that it can be done indirectly without a violation of good
faith. If it cannot be done openly, it cannot be done privily.
If it cannot be done above-board, it cannot be done
clandestinely. It is idle to reject the bid of the open
agent of a belligerent power and then at once accept
the bid of another who may be a mere man-of-straw,
unless after careful inquiry into his real character.</p>

<p>Nothing can be clearer than the duty of the proper
officers to consider all bids in the sunlight of the conspicuous
events then passing. A terrible war was convulsing
the Old World. Two mighty nations were in
conflict, one of which was already prostrate <i>and disarmed</i>.
Meanwhile came bids for arms and war material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
on a gigantic scale, on a scale absolutely unprecedented.
Plainly these powerful batteries, these muskets
by the hundred thousand, and these cartridges by
the million were for the disarmed belligerent and nobody
else. It was impossible not to see it. It is insulting
to common-sense to imagine it otherwise. Who
else could need arms and war material to the amount
of four million dollars at once? Now it appears by
the dispatches of the French Consul-General at New
York, which I find in an official document, that on
the 22d October, 1870, he telegraphed to the Armament
Commission at Tours:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The prices of adjudication have been 100,000 muskets
at $9.30; 40,000 at $12.30; 100,000 at $12.25; 50,000,000
cartridges at $16.30 the thousand: altogether, with the commission
to Remington and the incidental expenses, more than
four million dollars.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such gigantic purchases, made at one time, or in the
space of a few days, could have but one destination. It
is weakness to imagine otherwise. Obviously, plainly,
unquestionably, they were for the disarmed belligerent.
The telegraph each morning proclaimed the constant
fearful struggle, and we all became daily spectators.
In the terrible blaze, filling the heavens with lurid
flame, it was impossible not to see the exact condition
of the two belligerents,&mdash;Germany always victorious,
France still rallying for the desperate battle.
But the officials of the Ordnance Bureau saw this as
plainly as the people. Therefore were they warned,
so that every applicant for arms and war material on a
large scale was open to just suspicion. These officials
were put on their guard as much as if a notice or <i>caveat</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
had been filed at the War Department. In neglecting
that commanding notice, in overruling that unprecedented
<i>caveat</i>, so far as to allow these enormous supplies
to be forwarded to the disarmed belligerent, they
failed in that proper care required by the occasion. If
I said that they failed in good faith, I should only give
the conclusion of law on unquestionable facts.</p>

<p>In the case of the <i>Gran Para</i>, Chief-Justice Marshall,
after exposing an attempt to evade our neutral obligations
by an ingenious cover, exclaimed, in words which
he borrowed from an earlier period of our history, but
which have been often quoted since: “This would,
indeed, be a fraudulent neutrality, disgraceful to our
own Government, and of which no nation would be
the dupe.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I forbear at present to apply these memorable
words, which show with what indignant language
our great Chief-Justice blasted an attempt to
evade our neutral obligations. In calling it fraudulent
he was not deterred by the petty cry of a false patriotism,
that his judgment might affect the good name
of our country. Full well he knew that national character
could suffer only where fraud is maintained.</p>

<p>I doubt much if the true rule can be laid down in
better words than those I quoted on a former occasion
from the Spanish minister at Stockholm, denouncing
the sale of Swedish frigates.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He protested against
“arms and munitions furnished through <i>intermediate
speculators</i>, under pretence of not knowing the result,”
which he exhibited as an “act of hostility” and a
“political scandal.” According to this excellent protest,
the sale is not protected from condemnation
merely by “intermediate speculators” and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> “pretence
of not knowing the result.” And this is only according
to undoubted reason. It is simply a question
of good faith; and if, taking into view the circumstances
of the case and the condition of the times,
there is reasonable ground to believe that “intermediate
speculators” are purchasing for a belligerent,
then the sale cannot be made, nor will any “pretence
of not knowing the result” be of avail.</p>

<p>In harmony with this Spanish protest is the calm
statement of a Joint Committee of Congress, where
this question of international duty is treated wisely.
I read from the report of Mr. Jenckes on the sale of
certain ironclads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Perhaps the international feature of this transaction is
the most grave one for the consideration of Congress. It is
a matter of notorious public history that war was being carried
on in the years 1865 and 1866 between the Government
of Spain, on the one hand, and the Governments of
Peru and Chili, on the other. During the pendency of hostilities,
applications were made to obtain possession of these
vessels for one of the belligerents. If the Government of the
United States had been <i>privy</i> to any arrangement by which
these vessels of war should be delivered to the agents of a
belligerent, either in our own ports or upon the high seas,
it would certainly have violated its international obligations.
Of course, when Congress authorized the sale of these vessels,
it was known that individuals had no use for them; yet it
might have assumed, as in the case of the Dunderberg and
the Onondaga,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Now mark the words, if you please,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“that the Executive Department would take care that any
individual who should purchase with a view to a resale to
some foreign power would not be permitted to violate the
obligations of the United States as a neutral nation.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Observe, if you please, the language employed. If
the Government of the United States had been “privy”
to any arrangement for the delivery of these vessels to
the agents of a belligerent, it would certainly have violated
its international obligations. This is undoubtedly
correct. Then comes the assumption “that the Executive
Department would <i>take care</i> that any individual
who should purchase <i>with a view to a resale</i> to some
foreign power would not be permitted to violate the
obligations of the United States as a neutral nation.”
Here again is the true rule. The Executive is bound
to take care that there shall be no sale with a view to
a resale in violation of neutral duties.</p>

<p>All this is so entirely reasonable, indeed so absolutely
essential to the simplest performance of international
duty, that I feel humbled even in stating it.
The case is too clear. It is like arguing the Ten Commandments
or the Multiplication Table. International
Law is nothing but international morality for the guidance
of nations. And be assured, Sir, that interpretation
is the truest which subjects the nation most completely
to the Moral Law. “Thou shalt not sell arms to a belligerent,”
is a commandment addressed to nations, and to
be obeyed precisely as that other commandment, “Thou
shalt not steal.” No temptation of money, no proffer of
cash, no chink of “the almighty dollar,” can excuse any
departure from this supreme law; nor can any intervening
man-of-straw have any other effect than to augment
the offence by the shame of a trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, Sir, I am sensitive for my country. I can imagine
no pecuniary profits, no millions poured into the
Treasury, that can compensate for a departure from that
international honesty which is at once the best policy
and the highest duty. The dishonesty of a nation is illimitable
in its operation. How true are the words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“’Twill be recorded for a precedent;</div>
<div class="verse">And many an error, by the same example,</div>
<div class="verse">Will rush into the State: it cannot be.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The demoralization is felt not at home only. Whatever
any nation does is an example for other nations; whatever
the Great Republic does is a testimony. I would
have that testimony pure, lofty, just, so that we may welcome
it when commended to ourselves; so that, indeed, it
may be a glorious landmark in the history of civilization.</p>

<p>Therefore do I insist that international obligations, especially
when war is raging, cannot be evaded, cannot be
slighted, cannot be trifled with. They are not only sacred,
they are sacrosanct; and whoso lays hands on them,
whoso neglects them, whoso closes his eyes to their violation,
is guilty of a dishonesty which, to the extent of
its influence, must weaken public morals at home, while
it impairs the safeguards of peace with other nations and
sets ajar the very gates of War.</p>

<p>This question cannot be treated with levity, and waved
out of sight by a doubtful story. Even if Count Bismarck,
adapting himself to the situation, and anxious to
avoid additional controversy, had declared in conversation
that he would take these arms on the banks of the
Loire,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> this is no excuse for us. Our rule of duty is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
found in the courageous gayety of any foreign statesman,
but in the Law of Nations, which we are bound to obey,
not only for the sake of others, but for the sake of ourselves.
All other nations may be silent; Count Bismarck
may be taciturn; but we cannot afford to cry,
“Hush!” The evil example must be corrected, and the
more swiftly the better.</p>

<p>On this simple statement of International Law, it is
evident that there must be inquiry to see if through the
misfeasance of officials our Government has not in some
way failed to comply with its neutral duties. Subordinates
in England are charged with allowing the escape
of the Alabama. Have any subordinates among
us played a similar part? It is of subordinates that
I speak. Has the Government suffered through them?
Has their misfeasance, their jobbery, their illicit dealing,
compromised our country? Is there any ring about the
Ordnance Bureau through which our neutral duties have
been set at nought? Here I might stop without proceeding
further. The question is too grave to be blinked
out of sight; it must be met on the law and the facts.</p>

<p>In this presentation I do not argue. The case requires
a statement only. Beyond this I point to the honorable
example which our country has set in times past. The
equity with which we have discharged our neutral obligations
has been the occasion of constant applause.
Mr. Ward, the accomplished historian of the Law of
Nations, and also of a treatise on the “Rights and Duties
of Belligerent and Neutral Powers,” which Chancellor
Kent says “exhausted all the law and learning

after Washington’s retirement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of the great trading nations, America is almost the only
one that has shown consistency of principle. The firmness
and thorough understanding of the Laws of Nations, which
during this war [the French Revolution] she has displayed,
must forever rank her high in the scale of enlightened communities.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Another English writer, Sir Robert Phillimore, author
of the comprehensive work on International Law, speaks
of the conduct of the United States as, “under the most
trying circumstances, marked not only by a perfect consistency,
but by <i>preference for duty and right</i> over interest
and the expediency of the moment.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Then again,
in another place, the same English authority, after a summary
of our practice and jurisprudence in seizing and
condemning vessels captured in violation of neutrality,
declares:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In these doctrines a severe, <i>but a just</i>, conception of the
duties and rights of neutrality appears to be embodied.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

</div>

<p>An excellent French writer on International Law,
Baron de Cussy, remarks, on mentioning our course with
reference to a steamer purchased by Prussia in its war
with Denmark in 1849,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It affords a genuine proof of respect for the obligations
of neutrality.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

</div>

<p>American loyalty to neutral duties received the homage
of the eminent orator and statesman Mr. Canning,
who, from his place in Parliament, said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If I wished for a guide in a system of neutrality, I should

of Washington and the Secretaryship of Jefferson.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These testimonies may be fitly concluded by the
words of Mr. Rush, so long our Minister in England,
who records with just pride the honor accorded to our
doctrines on neutral duties:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They are doctrines that will probably receive more and
more approbation from all nations as time goes on, and continues
to bring with it, as we may reasonably hope, further
meliorations to the code of war. They are as replete with international
wisdom as with American dignity and spirit.…</p>

<p>“Come what may in the future, we can never be deprived
of this inheritance. It is a proud and splendid inheritance.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the great and honest fame already achieved
by our Republic in upholding neutral duties. No victory
in our history has conferred equal renown. Surely
you are not ready to forget the precious inheritance.
No, Sir, let us guard it as one of the best possessions
of our common country,&mdash;guard it loyally, so that it
shall continue without diminution or spot. Here there
must be no backward step. Not <i>Backward</i>, but <i>Forward</i>,
must be our watchword in the march of civilization.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am now brought to that other branch of the subject
which concerns directly the conduct of our officials;
and here my purpose is to simplify the question.
Therefore I shall avoid details, which have occupied the
Senate for days; and I put aside the apparent discrepancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
between the Annual Report of the War Department
and the Annual Report of the Treasurer, which
has been satisfactorily explained on this floor, so that
this ground of inquiry is removed. I bring the case to
certain heads, which, taken together in their mass, make
it impossible for us to avoid inquiry, without leaving the
Government or some of its officials exposed to serious
suspicion. Now, as at the beginning, I make no accusation
against any officer of our Government,&mdash;none
against the President, none against the Secretary of
War; but I exhibit reasons for the present proceeding.</p>

<p>The case naturally opens with the resolution of the
Committee of the French Assembly, asking the United
States “to furnish the result of the inquiry into the
conduct of American officials who were suspected of
participating in the purchase of arms for the French
Government during the war.” This seems to have been
adopted as late as February 9th last past. At least it
appears in the cable dispatch of that date.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> From this
resolution three things are manifest: first, that the sale
of arms by our Government is occupying the attention
of the French Legislature; secondly, that American officials
are suspected of participating in the purchase for
the French Government; and, thirdly, that it is supposed
that our Government has instituted an inquiry into the
case.</p>

<p>This resolution is, I believe, without precedent. I
recall no other instance where a foreign legislative assembly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
has made any inquiry into the conduct of the
officials of another country. If this were done in an
inimical or even a critical spirit, it might, perhaps, be
dismissed with indifference. But France, once in our
history an all-powerful ally, is now a friendly power,
with which we are in the best relations. Any movement
on her part with regard to the conduct of our
officials must be received according to the rules of
comity and good-will. It cannot be disregarded. It
ought to be anticipated. This resolution alone would
justify inquiry on our part.</p>

<p>Passing to evidence, I come to the telegraphic dispatch
of Squire, son-in-law and agent of Remington,
actually addressed in French cipher to the latter in
France, under date of October 8, 1870. Though brief,
it is most important:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have <i>the strongest influences</i> working for us, which
will use all their efforts to succeed.”</p>

</div>

<p>Considering the writer of this dispatch, his family
and business relations with Remington, to whom it was
addressed, it is difficult to regard it except as a plain
revelation of actual facts. It was important that Remington
should know the precise condition of things. His
son-in-law and agent telegraphs that “the strongest influences”
are at work for them. What can this mean?
Surely here is no broker or arms-merchant, engaged in
the course of business. It is something else,&mdash;plainly
something else. What? That is the point for inquiry.
Mr. Squire is an American citizen. Let him be examined
and cross-examined, under oath. Let him disclose
what he meant by “the strongest influences.” He could
not have intended to deceive his father-in-law, and puff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
himself. He was doubtless in earnest. Did he deceive
himself? On this he is a witness. But until those words
are so far explained as to show that they do not point to
officials, the natural inference is that it was on them
that he relied,&mdash;that they were “the strongest influences”
by which the job was to be carried through; for, of
course, it was a job which he announced.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that this dispatch of Mr. Squire
by itself alone is enough to justify inquiry. Without the
resolution of the French Assembly, and without the supplementary
testimony to be adduced, it throws a painful
suspicion upon our officials, which should compel them
to explain.</p>

<p>But the letter of Mr. Remington, already adduced,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
carries this suspicion still further, by adding his positive
testimony that he dealt with the Government. Before
referring again to this testimony, it is important to consider
the character of the witness; and here we have
the authentication of the Secretary of War, who has recommended
and indorsed him, in a formal paper to be
used in France. Others may question the statements
of Mr. Remington, but no person speaking for the Secretary
will hesitate to accept them. If the testimony
of the Secretary needed support, it would be found in
the open declarations on this floor by the Senator from
New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Conkling</span>], and in the following letter,
which the Senator dated from the Senate Chamber during
the recess, when notoriously the Senate was not in
session:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>,<br />
“<span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>, November 17, 1871.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I learn with surprise that your personal
and commercial situation and the good name of the house of
Remington &amp; Sons have been questioned. Having known
your father and sons for many years, having lived within
a stone-throw, so to say, of your house for a number of years,
and being one of the Senators of your State, I cannot hesitate
to give you my testimony relative to the accusations that have,
as has been told me, been brought against you in France.</p>

<p>“As to what concerns personal situation, importance of
affairs, success, solvency, wealth, and fidelity to the Government
of the United States, your house has for a long time
occupied a front rank, not only in the State of New York,
but also in the Union.</p>

<p>“The allegation that you lack experience as a manufacturer
of arms, or in anything that can, as a man of business, entitle
you to respect, is, I can affirm in all sincerity, destitute of
foundation, and must proceed from ignorance or malignity.</p>

<p class="sig">“Sincerely, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">Roscoe Conkling</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent medium">“Mr. <span class="smcap">Samuel Remington</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus does the Senator from New York vouch for the
“good name” of Mr. Remington.</p>

<p>Thus introduced, thus authenticated, and thus indorsed,
Mr. Remington cannot be rejected as a witness,
especially when he writes an official letter to the Chairman
of the French Armament Commission at Tours.
You already know something of that letter, dated at
New York, December 13, 1870. My present object is
to show how, while announcing his large purchases of
batteries, arms, and cartridges, he speaks of dealing with
Government always, and not even with any intermediate
agent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conkling.</span> Will the Senator allow me there one moment,
as he has referred to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conkling.</span> He is engaged at this point, if I understand
him aright, in supporting Mr. Remington in his character;
and as the document from which he made the translation
of my letter also contains stronger fortification in aid
of the Senator and of Mr. Remington, I beg to call attention
to it. The Senator might refer not only to my letter, but to
letters written by Governor Hoffman, ex-Governor Horatio
Seymour, Edwin D. Morgan, late a member of this body,
General John A. Dix, not unknown here, and other citizens
of the State of New York, who certify, I believe in somewhat
stronger terms than those I employed, to the probity and
standing of Mr. Remington.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I am obliged to the Senator for the additional
testimony that he bears. It only fortifies the authority
of Mr. Remington, which was my object. I took
the liberty of introducing the letter of the Senator, because
he is among us, and had vouched for Mr. Remington
personally. I gladly welcome the additional evidence
which the Senator introduces. It is entirely in
harmony with the case that I am presenting. I wish to
show how Mr. Remington was regarded by the Senator,
by the Secretary of War, and by other distinguished
citizens,&mdash;so that, when he writes an official letter to
the Chairman of the Arms Committee of Tours, he cannot
be rejected as a witness.</p>

<p>The letter is long, and early in it the writer alludes
to a credit from France and certain instructions with
regard to it, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This we could not do, as a considerable portion had been
<i>already paid out to the Government</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Then coming to the purchase of breech-loading Springfield
muskets, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>The Government</i> has never made but about seventy-five
thousand, all told; and forty thousand is the greatest number
<i>they think it prudent to spare</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>In order to increase the number he proposed an exchange
of his own, and here he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This question of an exchange, <i>with the very friendly feeling
I find existing to aid France</i>, I hope to be able to procure
more.”</p>

</div>

<p>Where was “the very friendly feeling existing to aid
France”? Not among merchants, agents, or brokers.
This would hardly justify the important declaration with
regard to a feeling which was so efficacious.</p>

<p>Then comes the question of cartridges; and here the
dealings with the Government become still more manifest:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Cartridges for these forty thousand will in a great measure
require to be made, as <i>the Government</i> have but about three
millions on hand. But <i>the Government</i> has consented to allow
the requisite number, four hundred for each gun, to be made,
and the cartridge-works have had orders, given yesterday, to
increase production to the full capacity of works.”</p>

</div>

<p>Observe here, if you please, the part performed by the
Government,&mdash;not only its consent to the manufacture,
but the promptitude of this consent. This was not easily
accomplished, as the well-indorsed witness testifies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This question of making the cartridges <i>at the Government
works</i> was a difficult one to get over. But it is done.”</p>

</div>

<p>Naturally difficult; but the agent of France overcame
all obstacles. Then as to price:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The price <i>the Government</i> will charge for the guns and
cartridges will be &mdash;&mdash;, or as near that as possible.”</p>

</div>

<p>Always “the Government”! Then comes another
glimpse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The forty thousand guns cannot all be shipped immediately,
as they are distributed <i>in the various arsenals throughout
the country</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>That is, the Government arsenals.</p>

<p>Then appears one of our officials on the scene:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>The Chief of Ordnance</i> thinks it may take twenty to
thirty days before all could be brought in.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then again the witness reports:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>The Chief of Ordnance</i> estimates the cost of the arms, including
boxing and expense of freight to bring them to New
York, at $20.60 currency.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then as to the harness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>The Government</i> have not full complete sets to the extent
of twenty-five hundred after selling the number required for
the fifty batteries.”</p>

</div>

<p>Always “the Government”!</p>

<p>Then, after mentioning that some parts of the harness
are wanting, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have made arrangements to have this deficiency made
good by either <i>the Government</i> or by outside persons.”</p>

</div>

<p>But the Government does all it can:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the mean time <i>the Government</i> have ordered the harness
to be sent here immediately.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then at the close the witness says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I forgot to say <i>the Government</i> have no Spencer rifles,
having never had but a small number, and all of those you
have bought.”</p>

</div>

<p>And he adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">that “they have from three to four thousand transformed
Springfields,” which he “may think best to take <i>after examination</i>,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">showing again his intimate dealings with the Government.</p>

<p>Such is the testimony of Mr. Remington, the acknowledged
agent of France. It is impossible to read these repeated
allusions to “the Government” and “the Chief of
Ordnance” without feeling that the witness was dealing
directly in this quarter. If there was any middleman,
he was of straw only; but a man-of-straw is nobody.
If Mr. Remington’s character were not vouched
so completely, if he did not appear on authentic testimony
so entirely above any misrepresentation, if he
were not elevated to be the model arms-dealer, this
letter, with its numerous averments of relations with
the Government, would be of less significance. But
how can these be denied or explained without impeaching
this witness?</p>

<p>But Mr. Remington is not without important support
in his allegations. His French correspondent, M. Le
Cesne, Chairman of the Armament Committee, has testified
in open court that the French dealt directly with
the Government. He may have been mistaken; but his
testimony shows what he understood to be the case. The
Senator from Missouri [Mr. <span class="smcap">Schurz</span>] has already called
attention to this testimony, which he cited from a journal
enjoying great circulation on the European continent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
“L’Indépendance Belge.” The Senator from Vermont,
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>,] not recognizing the character of this
important journal, distrusted the report. But this testimony
does not depend upon that journal alone. I have
it in another journal, “Le Courrier des États-Unis,” of
October 27, 1871, evidently copied from a Parisian journal,
probably one of the law journals, where it is given
according to the formal report of a trial, with question
and answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Presiding Judge.</span> Did not this indemnity of twenty-five
cents represent certain material expenses, certain disbursements,
incidental expenses?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">M. Le Cesne.</span> We could not admit these expenses; <i>for
we had an agreement with the American Federal Government,
which had engaged to deliver free on board all the arms on account
of France</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now I make no comment on this testimony except to
remark that it is in entire harmony with the letter of
Mr. Remington, and that beyond all doubt it was given
in open court under oath, and duly reported in the trial,
so as to become known generally in Europe. The position
of M. Le Cesne gave it authority; for, beside his
recent experience as Chairman of the Arms Committee,
he is known as a former representative in the Assembly
from the large town of Havre, and also a resident for
twenty years in the United States. In confirmation of
the value attached to this testimony, I mention that
my attention was first directed to it by Hon. Gustavus
Koerner, of Illinois, Minister of the United States at
Madrid, under President Lincoln.</p>

<p>To this cumulative testimony I add that already supplied
by our Minister at Berlin, under date of January 7,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
1871, and published by the Department of State, where
it is distinctly said that “recently rifled cannon and ammunition
have been furnished to the French in enormous
quantities, not only by private American traders, <i>but by
the War Department at Washington</i>.” This I have already
adduced under another head.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is mentioned
now to show how the public knowledge of Europe was
in harmony with the other evidence.</p>

<p>There is another piece of testimony, which serves to
quicken suspicion. It is already admitted by the Secretary
of War, that, after refusing Mr. Remington because
he was an agent of France, bids were accepted
from Thomas Richardson, who was in point of fact an
attorney-at-law at Ilion, and agent and attorney of Mr.
Remington. But the course of Mr. Remington, and his
relations with this country attorney, are not without official
illustration. Since this debate began I have received
a copy of a law journal of Paris, “Le Droit, Journal
des Tribunaux,” of January 18, 1872, containing the
most recent judicial proceedings against the French
Consul-General at New York. Here I find an official
report from the acting French Consul there, addressed
to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, under date of
August 25, 1871, where a fact is described which was
authenticated at the Consulate, being an affidavit or deposition
before a notary by a clerk of Mr. Remington,
on which the report remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This declaration establishing that this manufacturer caused
the books of his house to be recopied three times, and in doing
so altered the original form.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Report adds:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is in this document that mention is made of the character,
I might say criminal, which the name of Richardson
appears to have assumed in the affairs of Mr. Remington.”</p>

</div>

<p>After remarking that the witness who has thus testified
has exposed himself to the penalties of perjury,
being several years of imprisonment, the Report proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You see from this that the operations of Mr. Remington
give only too much of a glimpse of the most audacious
frauds.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here is testimony tending at least to stimulate inquiry:
Mr. Remington’s books altered three times, and
the name of Richardson playing a criminal part. I quote
this from an official document, and leave it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, then, are six different sources of testimony, all
prompting inquiry: first, the resolution of a committee
of the French Assembly, showing suspicion of American
officials; secondly, the cable dispatch of Squire, son-in-law
and agent of Mr. Remington, declaring that “we
have the strongest influences working for us, which will
use all their efforts to succeed”; thirdly, the letter of
Mr. Remington, reporting, in various forms and repetitions,
that he is dealing with the American Government;
fourthly, the testimony of M. Le Cesne, the Chairman of
the French Armament Committee, made in open court
and under oath, that the French “had an agreement with
the American Federal Government, which had engaged
to deliver free on board all the arms on account of
France”; fifthly, the positive declaration of the London
“Times” in the face of Europe, and reported by our
Minister at Berlin, that rifled cannon and ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
had been furnished to the French in enormous quantities
by the War Department at Washington; and, sixthly,
the testimony of a clerk of Mr. Remington, authenticated
by the French Consul-General at New York, that Mr.
Remington had altered his books three times, and also
speaking of the criminal character of Richardson in the
affairs of Mr. Remington. On this cumulative and concurring
testimony from six different sources is it not
plain that there must be inquiry? The Senate cannot
afford to close its eyes. The resolution of the committee
of the French Assembly alone would be enough; but reinforced
as it is from so many different quarters, the case
is irresistible. Not to inquire is to set at defiance all
rules of decency and common-sense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To these successive reasons I add the evidence, which
has been much discussed, showing a violation of the statute
authorizing the sale of “the old cannon, arms, and
other ordnance stores, now in possession of the War Department,
which are damaged or otherwise unsuitable
for the United States military service or for the militia
of the United States,”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>&mdash;inasmuch as stores were sold
which were not “damaged” or “otherwise unsuitable.”
I think no person can have heard the debate without
admitting that here at least is something for careful investigation.
The Senator from Missouri has already
exposed this apparent dereliction of duty, which in its
excess ended in actually disarming the country, so as
to impair its defensive capacity. One of the crimes
of the Cabinet of Mr. Buchanan on the eve of the Rebellion
was that the North had been disarmed. It is
important to consider whether, in the strange greed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
money or in the misfeasance of subordinates, something
similar was not done when good arms were sold to
France. The Chief of Ordnance, in his last Annual
Report, which will be found in the Report of the Secretary
of War, makes the following statement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now there are less than ten thousand breech-loading muskets
in the arsenals for issue. This number of muskets is not
half sufficient to supply the States with the muskets they are
now entitled to receive under their apportionment of the permanent
appropriation for arming and equipping the militia.”</p>

</div>

<p>Why, then, were breech-loading muskets exchanged
for French gold? The Chief of Ordnance then proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This Department should, as soon as possible, be placed
in a condition to fill all proper requisitions by the States upon
it, and should also have on hand in store a large number of
breech-loading muskets and carbines to meet any emergency
that may arise.”</p>

</div>

<p>But these very breech-loading muskets have gone to
France. The Chief of Ordnance adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Ten years ago the country felt that not less than a million
of muskets should be kept in store in the arsenals.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Why was not this remembered, when the arsenals
were stripped to supply France?</p>

<p>This important testimony speaks for itself. It is not
sufficient to recount against it the arms actually in the
national arsenals. The Chief of Ordnance answers the
allegation by his own statements. He regrets the small
number of breech-loading muskets on hand, and refers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
as an example to the standard ten years ago, when it was
felt that a million of muskets should be kept in store.
It is not I who say this; it is the Chief of Ordnance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But these several considerations, while making inquiry
imperative, do not touch the money question involved.
If in the asserted dealings with a belligerent power, in
violation of our neutral duties, there is reason to believe
corrupt practices of any kind, if there are large sums of
money that seem to be unaccounted for, then is there
additional ground for inquiry. Two questions are presented:
first, as to the violation of neutral duties; and,
secondly, as to misfeasance of subordinates involving
money. In both cases the question, I repeat, is of inquiry.</p>

<p>I do not dwell now on the sums lost by France in this
business. They are supposed to count by the million;
but here I make no allegation. I allude only to what
appears elsewhere.</p>

<p>Unquestionably there are enormous discrepancies between
the sums paid by France for arms actually identified
as coming from our arsenals and the sums received
by our Ordnance Bureau. In different reports these
discrepancies assume different forms. Not to repeat what
has been said on other occasions, I introduce the report
of the acting French Consul at New York, dated August
25, 1871, where, after showing that France received only
368,000 muskets and 53,000,000 cartridges, while the
accounts with Mr. Remington enumerate a sum-total of
425,000 arms and 54,000,000 cartridges, it is said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whence comes this difference of 57,000 between the arms
said to be sent from here and those which were received in
France, if in fact the report of M. Riant signifies that they
have only received a total of 368,000? How explain that
there were 425,000 put on the bills of lading, and that the
price of these was paid in New York?”</p>

</div>

<p>Now this discrepancy may be traced exclusively to
French agents, so that our subordinates shall not in any
way be involved; but when we consider all the circumstances
of this transaction, it affords grounds of inquiry.</p>

<p>But there is another witness on this head, not before
mentioned in this debate. I have here an extract from
the official report of M. de Bellonet, the French <i>Chargé
d’Affaires</i> at Washington, made to his Government on
this very question of losses down to a certain period.
His language is explicit: “The <i>dry loss</i> to the Treasury
of France must have been about $1,500,000, or seven
million francs.” This, be it remembered, is only a partial
report down to a certain period. Now there is nothing
in this report to charge this “dry loss” upon our officials.
It may be that it was all absorbed by the intermediate
agents. But taken in connection with the telegram of
Squire and the abundant letter of Mr. Remington, it
leaves a suspicion at least adverse to our officials.</p>

<p>Sir, let me be understood. I do not believe that any
inquiry by any committee can give back to France any
of the enormous sums she has lost. They have already
gone beyond recall into the portentous mass of her terrible
sacrifices destined to be an indefinite mortgage on
that interesting country. Not for the sake of France or
of any French claimant do I propose inquiry, but for
our sake, for the sake of our own country. We read of
that vast Serbonian bog “where armies whole have sunk.”
It is important to know if there is any such bog anywhere
about our Ordnance Office, where millions whole
have sunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Investigation is the order of the day. Already in
France, amid all the anxieties of her distracted condition,
these purchases of arms have occupied much attention.
As far back as last April, the “Soir,” a journal
at Versailles, where the Convention was sitting,
called for parliamentary inquiry. Its language was
strong:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A parliamentary inquiry made in full day can alone establish
either the culpability of some or the perfect honorableness
of others.”</p>

</div>

<p>And the same French organ added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Chamber, in consigning this matter to its pigeonholes,
refused satisfaction to an awakened public morality.”</p>

</div>

<p>There is, then, in France an awakened public morality,
as we hope there is also in the United States, which demands
investigation where there is suspicion of corrupt
practices. The French Chamber has instituted inquiry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, as a Republic, we are bound to the
most strenuous care, so that our example may not in
any way suffer. If we fail, then does Republican Government
everywhere feel the shock. For the sake of
others as well as of ourselves must we guard our conduct.
How often do I insist that we cannot at any moment,
or in any transaction, forget these great responsibilities!
As no man “liveth to himself,” so no nation “liveth”
to itself; especially is this the condition of the Great
Republic. By the very name it bears, and by its lofty
dedication to the rights of human nature, is it vowed
to all those things which contribute most to civilization,
keeping its example always above suspicion. That
great political philosopher, Montesquieu, announces that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the animating sentiment of Monarchy is “Honor,” but
the animating sentiment of a Republic is “Virtue.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I
would gladly accept this flattering distinction. Therefore,
in the name of that Virtue which should inspire
our Government and keep it forever above all suspicion,
do I move this inquiry.</p>

<p>On this whole matter the Senate will act as it thinks
best, ordering that investigation which the case requires.
For myself I have but one desire, which is, that this effort,
begun in the discharge of a patriotic duty, may redound
to the good of our country, and especially to the
purity of the public service.</p>

<p class="center">(A.) Page 15.</p>

<p class="center">AUTHORITIES REFERRED TO IN SPEECH.</p>

<p>Wheaton, our great authority, in Lawrence’s edition, page
727, quotes Vattel as laying down the rule of neutrality:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To give no assistance where there is no previous stipulation to
give it; nor voluntarily to furnish troops, arms, ammunition, or
anything of direct use in war.”</p>

</div>

<p>Vattel, as quoted, then says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not say, <i>To give assistance equally</i>, but, <i>To give no assistance</i>;
for it would be absurd that a State should assist at the same
time two enemies.”&mdash;<i>Le Droit des Gens</i>, Liv. III. ch. vii. § 104.</p>

</div>

<p>Another home authority, the late General Halleck, in his
work on International Law, after speaking of merchants engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in selling ships and munitions of war to a belligerent,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The act is wrong in itself, and the penalty results from his
violation of moral duty as well as of law. The duties imposed
upon the citizens and subjects flow from exactly the same principle
as those which attach to the government of neutral States.”</p>

</div>

<p>He then says, quoting another:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By these acts he makes himself personally a party to a war in
which, as a neutral, he had no right to engage, and his property is
justly treated as that of an enemy.”&mdash;<i>International Law</i>, p. 631.</p>

</div>

<p>Our other home authority, Professor Woolsey, in his work
on International Law, section 162, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“International Law does not require of the neutral sovereign
that he should keep the citizen or subject within the same strict
lines of neutrality which he is bound to draw for himself.”&mdash;<i>Introduction
to the Study of International Law</i>, 2d edition, p. 270.</p>

</div>

<p>That is, a citizen may sell ships and arms to a belligerent
and take the penalty, but the Government cannot do any such
thing.</p>

<p>Another authority of considerable weight, Bluntschli, the
German, lays down the rule as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The neutral State must neither send troops to a belligerent,
nor put ships of war at its disposal, nor furnish subsidies to aid it
in making the war.</p>

<p>“In coming <i>directly</i> to the aid of one of the belligerent powers
by the sending of men or war material, one takes part in the
war.”&mdash;<i>Droit International Codifié</i>, tr. <span class="smcap">Lardy</span>, art. 757, p. 381.</p>

</div>

<p>There is the true principle: “By the sending of men or
war material one takes part in the war.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the most important illustration of this question, and
the only case bearing directly on this point, which, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to my recollection, has ever been diplomatically discussed, is
one somewhat famous at the time, known as that of the
Swedish Frigate, which will be found in the second series of
“Causes Célèbres,” by Baron Charles de Martens.</p>

<p>It seems that in 1825, after ten years of peace, the Swedish
Government conceived the idea of parting with ships,
some of them more than twenty years old, as comparatively
useless. A contract for their sale was made with a commercial
house in London. The Spanish Government, by their
minister at Stockholm, protested, on the alleged ground, that,
though nominally sold to merchants, they were purchased for
the revolted colonies in Mexico and South America, and in
his communication, dated the 1st of July, 1825, used the following
energetic language, which I translate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And what would his Majesty the King of Sweden think,
on the supposition of the revolt of one of his provinces,&mdash;of the
kingdom of Norway for example,&mdash;if friendly and allied powers
furnished the rebels with arms, munitions, a fleet even, through
intermediate speculators, and under pretence of not knowing the
result&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I translate literally,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“intermediate speculators, and under pretence of not knowing the
result? Informed of these preparations, would the Cabinet of
Stockholm wait till the steel and the cannon furnished to its enemies
had mown down its soldiers, till the vessels delivered to the
rebels had annihilated its commerce and desolated its coasts, to
protest against similar supplies, and to prevent them if possible?
And if the protests were rejected, independently of every other
measure, would it not raise its voice throughout Europe, and at
the courts of all its allies, against this <i>act of hostility</i>, against this
violation of the rights of sovereignty, and against this <i>political
scandal</i>?”&mdash;<i>Causes Célèbres</i>, Tom. II. pp. 472-73.</p>

</div>

<p>These are strong words, but they only give expression to
the feelings naturally awakened in a Power that seemed to be
imperilled by such an act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>In another communication the same minister said to the
Swedish Government:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is the doctrine of irresponsibility which the Cabinet of
Stockholm professes with regard to the sale of these war vessels,
which excites the most lively representations on the part of the
undersigned.”&mdash;<i>Note of 15 July 1825</i>: Ibid., p. 480.</p>

</div>

<p>Mark the words, “the doctrine of irresponsibility.”
Then, again, the minister says in other words worthy of
consideration at this moment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Swedish Government on this occasion, creating this new
kind of commerce, determined to furnish ships of war indiscriminately
to every purchaser, even to private individuals without
guaranty,&mdash;establishing, as it seems to indicate, that the commercial
benefits of these sales are for the State a necessity of an order
superior to political considerations the most elevated, as to moral
obligations the most respectable.”&mdash;<i>Note of 9 September, 1825</i>:
Ibid., p. 486.</p>

</div>

<p>I ask if these words are not applicable to the present case?
Did it not become the Government of the United States at
this time, when making these large sales, almost gigantic, so
that its suspicion was necessarily aroused, to institute inquiry
into the real character of the purchaser? Was it not put on
its guard? Every morning told us of war unhappily raging
in Europe. Could there be doubt that these large purchases
were for the benefit of one of the belligerents? Was our
Government so situated that for the sake of these profits it
would neglect political considerations called in this dispatch
the most elevated, as moral obligations the most respectable?
Was it ready to assume the responsibility characterized by
the Spanish minister in a case less plain, as “an act of hostility,”
a “violation of the rights of sovereignty,” a “political
scandal”?</p>

OF SPECIAL COMMITTEES OF
THE SENATE.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Two Protests against the Competency of the Senate
Committee to Investigate the Sale of Arms to France;
March 26 and 27, 1872.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 26, 1872, Mr. Sumner appeared before the Committee to investigate
the sale of arms by the United States during the French and
German War, in response to a communication signed by the chairman
of the Committee requesting his attendance. After reading this communication,
Mr. Sumner proceeded to read and file a protest in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<h3>PROTEST.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">Personally, I object to no examination. Willingly
would I submit to the most searching scrutiny,
not only in the present case, but in all my public life.
There is not an act, letter, or conversation at any time,
that I would save from investigation. I make this statement,
because I would not have the protest I deem it my
duty to offer open to suspicion that there is anything I
desire to conceal or any examination I would avoid.</p>

<p>But appearing before the Committee on an invitation
which is in the nature of a summons, to testify in the
investigation originally moved by me into the sale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
arms to France, I am obliged to consider my duty as
a Senator. Personal inclinations, whatever they may
be, cannot be my guide. I must do what belongs to a
Senator under the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>Before answering any questions, I am constrained to
consider the competency of the Committee which has
summoned me. It is of less importance what these
questions may be, although there are certain obvious
limitations, to which I will allude at the outset.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The examination of a Senator by a Committee of the
Senate on a matter outside of the Senate, and not connected
with his public duties, is sustained by precedents,&mdash;as
when Mr. Seward and Mr. Wilson were
examined with reference to the expedition of John
Brown;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> but any examination with regard to his public
conduct, and especially with regard to a matter which he
has felt it his duty to lay before the Senate in the discharge
of his public duties, is of very doubtful propriety.
In his public conduct a Senator acts on his responsibility,
under sanction of an oath, and the Constitution
declares that “for any speech or debate” he “shall not
be questioned in any other place.” This inhibition,
while not preventing questions of a certain character,
must limit the inquiry; but the law steps forward with
its own requirements, according to which it is plain that
a Senator cannot be interrogated, first, with regard to his
conference with other Senators on public business, and,
secondly, with regard to witnesses who have confidentially
communicated with him.</p>

<p>Referring to the most approved work on the Law of
Evidence,&mdash;I mean that of Professor Greenleaf,&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
find under the head of “Evidence excluded from Public
Policy”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> at least four different classes of cases, which
may enlighten us in determining the questions proper
for Senators.</p>

<p>1. Communications between a lawyer and client. And
are not the relations of Senators, in the discharge of their
public duties, equally sacred?</p>

<p>2. Judges and arbitrators enjoy a similar exemption
with regard to matters before them.</p>

<p>3. Grand jurors, embracing even the clerk and prosecuting
officer, cannot be examined on matters before them.</p>

<p>4. Transactions between the heads of Departments and
their subordinate officers are treated as confidential.</p>

<p>Plainly, the conferences of a Senator, in the discharge
of his public duties, cannot be less protected.</p>

<p>This rule is equally imperative with regard to witnesses
who have confidentially communicated with a
Senator. Here again I quote Professor Greenleaf, who
quotes the eminent English judge of the close of the
last century, Lord Chief-Justice Eyre, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is a rule which has universally obtained on account
of its importance to the public for the detection of crimes, that
those persons who are the channel by means of which that detection
is made should not be unnecessarily disclosed.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then the learned professor proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All were of opinion that all those questions which tend to
the discovery of the channels by which the disclosure was made
to the officers of justice were, upon the general principles of the
convenience of public justice, to be suppressed; that all persons
in that situation were protected from the discovery.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>These words are explicit, and nobody can question
them.</p>

<p>I am led to make these remarks and adduce these authorities
because, perusing the testimony of Mr. Schurz,
I find that he was interrogated on these very matters;
and since I, too, am summoned as a witness, I desire to
put on record my sense of the impropriety of such questions.
It is important that they should not become a
precedent. And here again I declare that I have nothing
to conceal, nothing that I would not willingly give
to the world under any examination and cross-examination;
but I am unwilling to aid in the overthrow of a
rule of law which stands on unquestionable grounds of
public policy. Especially is it important in the Senate,
where, without such protection, a tyrannical majority
might deter a minority from originating unwelcome
inquiries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From these preliminaries I proceed to consider the
competency of the present Committee. Requested as a
Senator to appear before you, I deem it my duty to protest
against the formation and constitution of the Committee
as contrary to unquestionable requirements of
Parliamentary Law; and I ask the Committee to receive
this protest as my answer to their letter of invitation.
I make this more readily because in my speech in the
Senate, February 28, 1872, entitled “Reform and Purity
in Government, Neutral Duties, Sale of Arms to Belligerent
France,”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> I have set forth what moved me to the
inquiry, being grounds of suspicion, which, in my judgment,
rendered the most searching inquiry by a committee
friendly to inquiry absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>The general parliamentary rule in the appointment of
special committees requires that they should be organized
so as to promote the business or inquiry for which
the committee is created. This requirement is according
to obvious reason, and is sustained by parliamentary
authorities. In familiar language, a proposition is committed
to its friends and not to its enemies.</p>

<p>In illustration of this rule, we are told that members
who have spoken directly against what is called “the
body of the bill,” meaning, of course, the substance of
the inquiry, are not expected to serve on the committee,
but, should they be so nominated, to decline. Their
presence on a committee is not unlike participation in a
trial by a judge or juror interested in the result.</p>

<p>Very little reflection shows how natural is this rule
as an instrument of justice. The friends of a measure,
or the promoters of an inquiry, though in the majority
on a committee, can do no more than adduce evidence
that exists, so that the business cannot suffer through
them,&mdash;while those unfriendly to a measure, or hostile
to an inquiry, may, from lukewarmness, or neglect, or
possible prejudice, fail to present the proper evidence or
recognize its just value, so that the business will suffer.
In legislation, plainly, those who believe an inquiry necessary
are the most proper persons to conduct it, and
being so, they are selected by Parliamentary Law.</p>

<p>This rule may be traced in the history of Parliament
anterior to the settlement of our country. The ancient
statement was simply that “those against the bill should
not be on the committee.” The meaning of the rule
is distinctly seen in historic cases, which I proceed to
adduce.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons, as far back as November 7,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
1601, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, on the commitment
of a bill relating to misdemeanors, the entry in the
Journal mentions that it was delivered to a certain
member, and then says, “and Mr. Serjeant Harris to be
<i>exempted out of the Committee</i>, because he spake against
the body of the Bill,” according to the ancient order in
Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In other words, a speech against a measure
disqualified the learned member, so that, according
to the expressive words, he was “exempted out of the
Committee.”</p>

<p>Again, in the case of the commitment of a bill affecting
the city of London, which came up November 11,
1601, on the question whether the members for London,
known to be against the bill, could be of the Committee,
the rule of the House was stated in these positive
words: “That those against the Bill should be no Committees.”
Of course, this rule was not merely of <i>form</i>,
but of <i>substance</i>. It meant that those really against the
measure were not proper for the Committee, all of which
appeared in the recorded debate and proceedings that
ensued. A leading member, Mr. Wiseman, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The House allowing of this Bill to be committed are, in
my opinion, to <i>disallow</i> any that will be against the Body of
the Bill for being Committees.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sir Edward Hobby followed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And for my own opinion, I think that he that is against
the Body of the Bill can be no Committee.”</p>

</div>

<p>The report then proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Then the Speaker stood up and said, ‘… All that will
have a man that hath been against the Body of the Bill to be
a Committee, let them show their opinions by saying <i>Yea</i>.’
And not one said <i>Yea</i>. ‘All that will not, say <i>No</i>.’ And all
said <i>No</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>I take this important precedent from Townshend’s
“Historical Collections: or, An Exact Account of the
Proceedings of the Four Last Parliaments of Q. Elizabeth,”
pp. 208, 209. The same account is found also in
D’Ewes’s “Journals of all the Parliaments during the
Reign of Queen Elizabeth,” pp. 634-35.</p>

<p>Thus, on submission of the question by the Speaker,
the House unanimously decided that they would “not
have a man that hath been against the Body of the Bill
to be a Committee.” According to the report, “All said
<i>No</i>”; and that unanimous “No” is the voice of Parliamentary
Law, repeated ever since. The phrase “against
the Body of the Bill” is strong and suggestive, showing
the purpose to exclude those who were unfriendly to the
measure.</p>

<p>Following the history of the rule, we meet it again,
as stated by Hakewel in his “Modus tenendi Parliamentum,”
published in 1671:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He that speaketh directly against the body of the bill
may not be named a committee; for he that would totally
destroy will not amend.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here again is the declared purpose to save the measure
from the hands of enemies.</p>

<p>Then follows a case remarkable for words which have
become familiar in Parliamentary Law. It was that of
Colonel Birch, who, February 11, 1677, brought into Parliament
a Bill for Settling a Public Register for Lands in
the several Counties, and in his remarks said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I begged you formerly <i>not to put the child to a nurse that
cared not for it</i>. For it was formerly committed to two lawyers,
and the thing was lost.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the commitment of a bill for reform in law to
“two lawyers” was condemned, because they were a
nurse that did not care for it; and the casual remark of
the author of the bill has become historical. There is
good law as well as sense in his saying, that a child is
not put to a nurse that cares not for it. Parliamentary
Law, in the creation of special committees, always seeks
those who care for the business, whatever it may be.
One against an inquiry, or believing that there is no occasion
for it, is repudiated by this rule, so just and benign,
and also so venerable with years.</p>

<p>The preparation of articles of impeachment against
the Earl of Danby, Lord High Treasurer in the reign of
Charles the Second, December 21, 1678, presented the
same rule in another aspect. It was no longer a bill, but
an inquiry or investigation, when the Speaker said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No man, by the ancient rules of the House, is to be of a
committee of a <i>thing</i> he is against.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the language is somewhat broadened, though in
entire keeping with the other cases. A man cannot be
on a committee “of a <i>thing</i> he is against.” In other
words, if he is against the inquiry for which a committee
is created, he cannot be on it. And here again good
faith requires that the rule should be observed not
merely in form, but in substance.</p>

<p>These cases were analyzed and adopted by Mr. Jefferson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in his authoritative “Manual”; so that they have
become American Parliamentary Law, as obligatory here
as in England. Speaking always by their essential
reason, but with the weight of precedent also, they are
not less binding than if promulgated with an enacting
clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Jefferson furnishes other and most important
words of his own:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And when any member who is against the bill hears
himself named of its committee, <i>he ought to ask to be excused</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is the language of our Manual, declaring the
duty of a member who hears himself named of a committee
on a bill he is against. Of course the general
rule is applicable to any other matter referred to a committee.
The words are, “he <i>ought</i> to ask to be excused.”
Of course his continuance on the committee, or any attempt
to exercise its duties, is a violation of Parliamentary
Law, unless you are ready to discard this positive
injunction.</p>

<p>Mr. Jefferson then adds, by way of illustration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus, March 7, 1606, Mr. Hadley was, on the question
being put, excused from being of a committee, declaring himself
to be against the matter itself.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And our great authority declares that this is “a
constant rule.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Such is Parliamentary Law; and Mr. Jefferson has
answered in advance the possible objection, that this is
English and not American. After saying, in his preface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to the “Manual,” that the Senate has given to these
rules “the sanction of their approbation,” he announces
“the law of proceedings in the Senate as composed of
the precepts of the Constitution, the regulations of the
Senate, and, where these are silent, of <i>the rules of Parliament</i>.”
Such, according to him, is the law of our proceedings.
The “Manual” which he presents he hopes
others may fill up, “<i>till a code of rules</i> shall be formed
for the use of the Senate, the effects of which may be
accuracy in business, economy of time, order, uniformity,
and impartiality.” The last word is “<i>impartiality</i>,”
which, doubtless, is a main object to be secured.</p>

<p>Any one disposed to neglect these rules will find a
warning from Mr. Jefferson. In his opening chapter he
quotes these words from the famous Speaker Onslow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That these forms, as instituted by our ancestors, operated
as a check and control on the actions of the majority, and
that they were in many instances a shelter and <i>protection to
the minority against the attempts of power</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Jefferson follows this quotation by declaring “the
forms and rules of proceeding” to be “the only weapons
by which the minority can defend themselves,” and by
which “the weaker party can be protected from those
irregularities and abuses which these forms were intended
to check, and which the wantonness of power is
but too often apt to suggest to large and successful
majorities.”</p>

<p>Thus is the parliamentary rule which forbids a person
unfriendly to the business of the committee, whatever
it may be, whether bill or inquiry, from serving on
the committee, one of those inhibitions by which public
business is promoted, by which impartiality is secured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and especially by which a minority is shielded against
the wantonness of power.</p>

<p>“The Congressional Globe” makes it easy to apply
what has been said to several of this Committee. Unless
the law, as illustrated by ancient cases, and adopted
by Mr. Jefferson, is entirely neglected, unless the rule
so frequently enunciated is set at defiance or treated as
a sham, there are at least three serving on the Committee
in violation of Parliamentary Law. In undertaking
to serve, they were undoubtedly oblivious of the
time-honored requirement, or did not appreciate its
stringency.</p>

<p>Not only every Senator, but the whole country has an
immeasurable interest in the preservation of those rules
by which what Mr. Jefferson justly calls “the wantonness
of power” is restrained, and minorities are protected
against majorities. Any shock to them, as in the present
case, becomes a precedent by which liberty and justice
suffer. As a Senator appearing before this Committee
at their request, I deem it my duty to file this
Protest, in the sincere hope, that, whatever may be the
result of the present inquiry, the open violation of Parliamentary
Law in the formation and constitution of the
Committee will not be permitted to become a precedent
hereafter. When law is sacrificed, individuals may for
a moment seem to triumph, but it is at the cost of a
great safeguard for the good of all.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Carpenter, of the Committee, it was ordered that
a subpœna in regular form be issued to Mr. Sumner, returnable the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
next day, to be served by the Sergeant-at-Arms; which was duly issued
and served.</p>

<p>March 27th, Mr. Sumner appeared, and, after the reading of the
subpœna, proceeded to read a second Protest.</p>

</div>

<h3>SECOND PROTEST.</h3>

<p>Since reading and filing my Protest yesterday, I have
received by the hands of the Sergeant-at-Arms a subpœna
commanding me to appear before this Committee.
In answer to this subpœna, I now appear.</p>

<p>It is my duty to declare that my judgment as originally
set forth in my Protest is in no respect altered
by this subpœna. I do not think the Committee more
competent to-day than yesterday. I still find several
occupying seats on the Committee in violation of an
unquestionable rule of Parliamentary Law. The record
shows that they signalized themselves in the Senate by
open speech against the pending inquiry and those who
brought it forward, or, according to the language of the
old rule, “against the thing,” and therefore disqualified
themselves as much as a judge who has been counsel in
a case, or a juror who has declared his opinion beforehand.
This disqualification is not founded on argument
or inference, but on peremptory rule, traced back many
generations, illustrated by numerous authorities, and
constituting part of what Mr. Jefferson calls the “code”
for the government of the Senate, having, as he says,
“the sanction of their approbation.”</p>

<p>Besides the authorities which I cited yesterday, there
are two others from our own country, which I deem it
my duty to adduce. The first is that of Cushing’s “Lex
Parliamentaria Americana” or “The Law and Practice of
Legislative Assemblies in the United States.” Here we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
learn how completely a committee is placed by Parliamentary
Law in the hands of the mover, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It became the established practice for the member upon
whose motion a committee had been ordered, to move the
names of the members to compose it,&mdash;being, of course, of
his own selection: his own name being among them, and
perhaps the first named on the list. If he felt any delicacy
in moving his own name, the motion might be made by some
friend: as on the occasion of the appointment of the committee
to prepare articles of impeachment against Lord Melville,
which had been ordered on the motion of Mr. Whitbread,
that gentleman was first appointed one of the committee
on the motion of Lord Temple, and then on the motion
of Mr. Whitbread the other members of the committee
(Lord Temple being one) were appointed.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As this was a case of investigation, it is a precedent
for us now. But our Committee was constituted in a
very different manner. Mr. Cushing vindicates the
practice of allowing the mover of a proposition himself
to nominate the committee for the consideration of the
House, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the House, by adopting the resolution for the committee,
has signified its willingness that the subject should be
so considered or investigated; that the member nominating
the committee must be supposed to feel as strong an interest
in the proper consideration of the subject as any one, and also
to possess or to be willing to obtain the knowledge necessary
to enable him to decide upon the qualifications of the members
he selects.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In this vindication the careful and elaborate author
shows how completely the early rule is recognized. The
same learned authority, while stating the English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
American Parliamentary Law, shows how the examination
is conducted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When an inquiry is instituted and an examination of
witnesses undertaken by the House in its inquisitorial capacity,
it is customary for the member on whose motion or suggestion
the inquiry has been engaged in, or for some of the
members voting with him for the inquiry, to take the lead in
the examination of the witnesses, … or, in other words,
to examine the witnesses in chief.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Plainly, according to this usage, Mr. Schurz, and not
Mr. Hamlin, should take the lead and examine the witnesses
in chief.</p>

<p>The other parliamentary authority to which I refer is
Hon. R. M. T. Hunter, former Speaker of the House of
Representatives. In his valedictory speech, March 3,
1841, this gentleman, who brought thought and study
to the discharge of his public duties, took occasion to
explain the principles governing the formation of committees,
and all must admit that he did it with a clearness
and philosophy not surpassed in parliamentary history.
According to him, those having the affirmative of
a proposition should have the direction of the committee.
Speaking generally, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The party upon which it naturally devolves to propose a
question ought to have the power, it would seem, to present
its proposition in the shape for which it is willing to be responsible;
and as the different parties hold the affirmative
according to the nature of the question, so ought the constitution
of the committees to be varied.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then, in language precisely applicable to the present
case, the Speaker says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In committees of investigation it is equally clear that the
opposition, <i>who hold the affirmative</i>, should have the majority
and the power.”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This instructive statement is in admirable harmony
with the rule, as declared in early times, that those
“against the thing” cannot go on the committee,&mdash;and
that a measure, like a child, is not put to a nurse that
cares not for it. The old Parliamentarians were less philosophical
than the American Speaker, but each meant
the same thing. The prime object is opportunity and
fair play for those bringing forward a proposition, or
holding the affirmative. A committee <i>organized to sustain
the negative</i> is the very committee described as a
nurse that cares not for the child, and therefore is a committee
not tolerated by Parliamentary Law.</p>

<p>Thus from all quarters&mdash;beginning with the distant in
time, embracing Jefferson, the father of American Parliamentary
Law, Cushing, its most authoritative American
expounder, and not forgetting an American Speaker&mdash;proceeds
concurring testimony to the parliamentary rule
requiring an inquiry to be placed in the hands of its
friends; especially is it necessary that the chairman, who
directs the inquiry and examines the witnesses, should
be known as one of its friends.</p>

<p>Therefore I must be pardoned, if I renew my Protest
against the competency of the present Committee. I
protest against it as constituted in flagrant violation of
Parliamentary Law; and I protest especially against the
acting Chairman, who undertakes to direct this inquiry
and to examine witnesses, as not coming within the
conditions established by rule, by usage, and by reason.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
The record shows that he did not move the inquiry, nor
did he coöperate with the mover, or take any part in
sustaining him, while in open speech he showed himself
“against the thing.” I object to the acting Chairman
as to a judge or juror disqualified to sit in a court.</p>

<p>I make this second Protest with infinite reluctance.
But the Committee leave me no alternative. In their
invitation, in the nature of a summons, and now in their
subpœna, they compel me to declare my objection to
their competency. Seeing it as clearly as I do, and feeling
it as strongly as I do, I cannot avoid expressing it.
If I do so twice, it is because the Committee have laid
me twice under this obligation. Beyond that sentiment
of duty which is with me a rule of life, I am encouraged
to this effort by the hope that, even if the present Committee
cannot be corrected in conformity with Parliamentary
Law, its incompetency is so clearly exposed that
it will be powerless hereafter as a precedent. If obliged
to witness the present dishonor of a time-honored rule,
I would at least save this safeguard for the future.</p>

<p>In thus declaring my profound sense of the wrong
that has been attempted, I do all in my power to maintain
Parliamentary Law inviolate. I regret that I cannot
do more.</p>

<p>With this explanation, and yielding to the command
of the Committee, I offer myself for examination on matters
proper for inquiry; but I do it under protest.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On the question of concurrence in an amendment made in Committee
of the Whole relative to the free list, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I move to amend that amendment by adding after
the provision as to books, as arranged alphabetically
in the free list,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Books in the ancient and foreign languages.</p>

</div>

<p>I have letters very often from learned professors in
different parts of the country, complaining of the cost of
books that they are constrained to purchase in order to
carry on their studies and to enable them to teach. This
is the case with Greek professors, professors in all the
languages, ancient and modern. It is also the case with
men of science, who desire works in the Continental languages;
they complain bitterly of the expense to which
they are put.</p>

<p>Now, if I can have the attention of the Senate one
moment, I will endeavor to show that these works cannot
come in competition with any books here at home.
Certainly they cannot with regard to any considerable
interest. I think, if these could be put on the free list,
an essential service would be done; the revenue would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
lose very little, and no considerable interest in our country
would suffer. I hope, therefore, there can be no question
but that the Senate will allow this to be adopted.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill</span> [of Vermont]. I trust this amendment will
not be adopted. It is evidently an old acquaintance of the
Senate. I think the Senator from Massachusetts has always
moved it whenever he has had an opportunity.</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>To the argument advanced by Mr. Morrill in support of this objection,&mdash;namely,
“that the school-books of America should be American
in character, and printed and published by American publishers,”&mdash;Mr.
Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The argument of my friend is against
English books, and not books in ancient or foreign languages.
At any rate, the chief point of his argument was
addressed to works in the English language. He called
our attention, for instance, to Smith’s “Dictionary of the
Bible,” an English work; and he knows well, that, as it
is a recent work, it is not on our free list, and the amendment
which I move does not touch it. My amendment
concerns books in the ancient languages, and in foreign
languages, that is, in the languages of modern Europe;
and the single point of the Senator is school-books. Now
I ask whether we should not do all we can to make the
school-books as cheap as possible? Will the Senator put
a protective duty on school-books?&mdash;make the child
with “shining morning face” as he goes to school pay a
duty? I would have the school-books as cheap as possible.
But then how few are the school-books that would
come in under this provision?</p>

<p>My amendment reaches the large amount of works
concerning science and literature and jurisprudence in
ancient and in foreign languages; and why should these
be subjected to a duty? Why should those scholars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
those enlightened professional men who import these
books, be subjected to this additional expense? Sir, I
honor the man, whether of scholarship, of science, or of
a profession, who imports these works of learning. He
is a benefactor to his country. Every such work becomes
a fountain in the neighborhood: but I would not
put a duty on that fountain; I would unseal it; I would
open it, and let it flow as amply as possible.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill</span> [of Maine]. I should like to ask the Senator
from Massachusetts whether there are any books in foreign languages
that are not published in this country. Are not all the
books in the ancient languages published in this country?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I beg to call the Senator’s attention to
the boundless annual literature of Germany, where the
volumes are counted by the thousand,&mdash;to the extensive
literature of France, where the volumes are counted by
the thousand,&mdash;to the less ample literature of Spain and
Italy, with numerous publications, all of which, if imported,
pay a duty. Now I wish to encourage that importation.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> I understood the Senator’s argument to be
in favor of ancient books.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It is also, certainly.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morrill.</span> My inquiry is, whether those books are not
all republished in this country.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Not at all. For instance, take most of
the considerable works of scholarship in German, annually
produced, bearing on the classics; they are not republished
in our country, but our professors import them
at cost. Then take another class of works, on science,
in the German language, in the French language,&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
would say also in the Italian language, for there are
some excellent contributions to science as well as to
literature in the Italian language,&mdash;those, if imported,
pay a duty; but they do not come into competition with
anything printed here. Why, then, should they pay a
duty? Why not encourage their importation? Why
not help the man of science, or the learned professor,
who aspires to enlarge his library in this way? I have
said that I regard such a person as a benefactor. I wish
to give him my thanks, and my help, if I can. The best
help I can give him is to try to save him from this additional
tax.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Beyond the interest in these letters as another
instance of a peculiar literature,&mdash;illustrated
by Major Jack Downing, Sam Slick, and the genius of
Hosea Biglow,&mdash;they have an historic character from
the part they performed in the war with Slavery, and in
advancing Reconstruction. Appearing with a certain
regularity and enjoying an extensive circulation, they
became a constant and welcome ally. Unquestionably
they were among the influences and agencies by which
disloyalty in all its forms was exposed, and public opinion
assured on the right side. It is impossible to measure
their value. Against the devices of Slavery and its
supporters, each letter was like a speech, or one of those
songs which stir the people. Therefore they belong to
the political history of this critical period.</p>

<p>Of publications during the war, none had such charm
for Abraham Lincoln. He read every letter as it appeared,
and kept them all within reach for refreshment.
This strong liking illustrates his character, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
always awaken an interest in the letters. An incident in
my own relations with him shows how easily he turned
from care to humor.</p>

<p>I had occasion to see President Lincoln very late in
the evening of March 17th, 1865. The interview was
in the familiar room known as his office, and also used
for cabinet meetings. I did not take leave of him until
some time after midnight, and then the business was
not entirely finished. As I rose, he said, “Come to me
when I open shop in the morning; I will have the order
written, and you shall see it.” “When do you open
shop?” said I. “At nine o’clock,” he replied. At the
hour named I was in the same room that I had so recently
left. Very soon the President entered, stepping
quickly with the promised order in his hands, which he
at once read to me. It was to disapprove and annul
the judgment and sentence of a court-martial in a case
that had excited much feeling. While I was making
an abstract of the order for communication by telegraph
to the anxious parties, he broke into quotation from
Nasby. Finding me less at home than himself with
his favorite humorist, he said pleasantly, “I must
initiate you,” and then repeated with enthusiasm the
message he had sent to the author: “For the genius to
write these things I would gladly give up my office.”</p>

<p>Rising from his seat, he opened a desk behind, and,
taking from it a pamphlet collection of the letters
already published, proceeded to read from it with infinite
zest, while his melancholy features grew bright. It
was a delight to see him surrender so completely to the
fascination. Finding that I listened, he read for more
than twenty minutes, and was still proceeding, when
it occurred to me that there must be many at the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
waiting to see him on graver matters. Taking advantage
of a pause, I rose, and, thanking him for the lesson
of the morning, went away. Some thirty persons, including
Senators and Representatives, were in the antechamber
as I passed out.</p>

<p>Though with the President much during the intervening
time before his death, this was the last business
I transacted with him. A few days later he left Washington
for City Point, on the James River, where he was
at the surrender of Richmond. April 6th I joined him
there. April 9th the party returned to Washington.
On the evening of April 14th the bullet of an assassin
took his life.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, April 7, 1872.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;In reply to your inquiry, I make
haste to say, that, in my judgment, the Colored
Convention should think more of principles than of men,&mdash;except
so far as men stand for principles. Above
all, let them insist on the rights of their own much-abused
and insulted people.</p>

<p>It is absurd for anybody to say that he “accepts the
situation,” and then deny the equal rights of the colored
man. If the “situation” is accepted in good faith, it
must be entirely,&mdash;including not merely the abolition
of Slavery and the establishment of equal suffrage, but
also all those other rights which are still denied or
abridged. There must be complete equality before the
law, so that in all institutions, agencies, or conveniences,
created or regulated by law, there can be no discrimination
on account of color, but a black man shall
be treated as a white man.</p>

<p>In maintaining their rights, it will be proper for the
Convention to invoke the Declaration of Independence,
so that its principles and promises shall become a living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
reality, never to be questioned in any way, but recognized
always as a guide of conduct and a governing
rule in the interpretation of the National Constitution,
being in the nature of a Bill of Rights preceding the
Constitution.</p>

<p>It is not enough to “proclaim liberty throughout all
the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.” Equality
must be proclaimed also; and since both are promised
by the great Declaration, which is a national act, and as
from their nature they should be uniform throughout
the country, both must be placed under the safeguard
of national law. There can be but one liberty and one
equality, the same in Boston and New Orleans, the same
everywhere throughout the country.</p>

<p>The colored people are not ungenerous, and therefore
will incline to any measures of good-will and reconciliation;
but I trust no excess of benevolence will make
them consent to any postponement of those equal rights
which are still refused. The disabilities of colored people,
loyal and long-suffering, should be removed before
the disabilities of former Rebels; or at least the two removals
should go hand in hand.</p>

<p>It only remains that I should say, “Stand firm!” The
politicians will then know that you are in earnest, and
will no longer be trifled with. Victory will follow soon,
and the good cause be secure forever.</p>

<p>Meanwhile accept my best wishes for the Convention,
and believe me, dear Professor,</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron, having moved to take up a joint resolution reported
by him from the Committee on Foreign Relations, “permitting certain
diplomatic and consular officers of the United States in France to accept
testimonials from the Emperor of Germany for their friendly services
toward the subjects of the Emperor during the war between France
and Germany,”&mdash;Mr. Sumner promptly protested:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I must object to it with my whole soul. I consider

any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign State.”</p>

</div>

<p>Not even from the German Empire. Congress has
followed one rule from the beginning, I believe,&mdash;never
to allow its diplomatic agents to receive anything from
a foreign power. It has allowed its naval officers, who
have rendered some humane service at sea to the subjects
of a foreign power, to receive some reward or recognition,
some honor, some compliment; but it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
never allowed any person in its diplomatic service to
receive any such reward, honor, or compliment. I think
the Senate will see that this rule proceeds on a ground
from which we cannot depart. It is, that our representatives
abroad must be kept always above all suspicion
of acting under foreign influence, or the temptation
of foreign reward. Nor should we, Sir, be gratified, I
think, to see these representatives abroad wearing at
their button-holes the insignia of any foreign power.</p>

<p>I hope, Sir, the Senate will not take up this matter
again. It ought to be allowed to drop out of sight.</p>

<h2><a name="PRESERVATION_OF_THE_PARK_AT" id="PRESERVATION_OF_THE_PARK_AT"></a>PRESERVATION OF THE PARK AT
WASHINGTON.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, May 15, 1872.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate having under consideration a bill from the House confirming
a grant by the City Council of Washington of a site for a railway
dépôt in the public park, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;To my mind this bill is injudicious;
and in saying this I give an opinion
reached after the most careful consideration of it in the
Committee. I think it ought not to be adopted by the
Senate. I say this with reluctance, for I sympathize
keenly with every improvement and with every facility
afforded to this growing and beautiful metropolis; and
may I say, also, I feel a personal sympathy with the
distinguished citizen of Pennsylvania particularly interested
in this measure? And yet, approaching its consideration
with those biases in its favor, I am bound to
conclude against it.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think that this privilege ought to be
granted, and my reason is precise and specific. It proposes
to take a considerable section of land, which, if
you look on the map, you will see properly belongs to
the Park of Washington. I am unwilling, at this early
period in the history of this metropolis, to begin by cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
out a slice from this inclosure set apart for the future.
If you do it now, where are you to stop? Will
you not be called to cut out another slice next year, or
in five years,&mdash;and may not the Park be reduced from
that form and those proportions it promises to enjoy?
This metropolis is now at its beginning, and yet doubling
in a decade. During the last ten years its population
has multiplied twofold; and in the coming ten
years there is every reason to believe that the development
will be as large, if not larger. Of course with the
increase of population is the demand for a park, especially
in the central situation which that enjoys. I use the
language of another, when I say that parks are the lungs
of a great city; but where will be the lungs of this metropolis,
if you begin now to reduce the Park? Rather
should we sacredly keep it all intact, so that hereafter,
when you and I, Sir, have passed away, and this metropolis
has grown to a grandeur and beauty which imagination
cannot now conceive, that Park may remain in its
entirety, a blessing to the people, for which they themselves
in turn will bless us.</p>

<p>Sir, I was born in a city which has the enjoyment of
such a blessing. There is in Boston what is known as
The Common, set apart in the very earliest days of the
old town, when it was in fact what the name implies,&mdash;a
common for the pasturage of cattle; but, though often
assailed, it has been preserved untouched. Railroad
corporations and other companies have tried in vain to
obtain a corner from it. The jealous city fathers have
saved that beautiful piece of earth, till now it is the first
treasure of Boston,&mdash;unless we except her common
schools, where all are equal before the law. I have often
thought what would have ensued if some time ago, yielding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
to corporation pressure in its various forms, the city
had consented to sacrifice that beautiful inclosure. There
it is, the very apple of the eye to Boston; and nobody
now fears that it will be diminished by a foot.</p>

<p>And should not Washington have a similar possession?
Are you willing, Sir, now at this early moment of her
history, when she is just beginning to grow, or rather
when her growth is just beginning to be apparent, to despoil
her of this unquestionable attraction, where the
useful and the beautiful commingle? I think, Sir, you
will act improvidently, if you do so. I think you will
act against the best interests of the city, whether you
look at health, beauty, or enjoyment; for a park ministers
to all these.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, would I keep it intact. By no consent
of Congress would I allow any business interest or disturbing
railroad company to fasten itself upon this inclosure.
They should be excluded; and when I say this,
I would not carry them off far. Let them plant their
stations just the other side. They will then be perhaps
a third of a mile from Pennsylvania Avenue, traversing
the centre of population with conveniences such as railroads
in no other city enjoy. With those open to
them, why should we allow them to enter our pleasure-grounds?
If there were no proper place without going
a long distance, a mile or two miles, there would be
some reason, perhaps, for entertaining this question; but
when I consider the facilities which they may enjoy
only the other side of the Park line, with land there
cheap and easy to be had, I am astonished that any
one can be willing to sacrifice the Park simply to bring
them a few rods nearer Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

<p>And this brings me to the question of travel on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Avenue. If you put a railway station as is proposed,
you will bring on the Avenue all that glut and accumulation
of carriages and wagons always concentrated
about the terminus of a great line of travel. I think it
will be injurious to the Avenue. That alone would be
a reason with me against the bill.</p>

<p>But as often as I think of the question, I come back
to the Park, which, say what you will, is destined to be
one of the most important possessions of this metropolis,
and for the special enjoyment of the people. They will
enjoy this Capitol, for it is beautiful to behold,&mdash;also
the other public edifices, some of them excellent in style
and grateful to the eye; but nothing of all these will be
what we may expect that Park to be,&mdash;a place where
the young and old will resort of an evening to enjoy innocent
recreation and congenial society, while the open
air or the opportunities of exercise impart to them that
best blessing, health. Sir, that Park should not be sacrificed;
and if you have any doubt, let me lay before you
the testimony of another place. I have already cited
Boston; I now call your attention to Philadelphia. You
know the remarkable park which has been opened there.
I stopped a day in Philadelphia last summer, on my
way home, especially to see and enjoy this magnificent
resort; and I was well rewarded. I beheld the most
beautiful park, certainly in its promise, on this continent;
and I doubt if there is one even in the European
world of equal promise. But no one can enter its
grounds without annoyance and trouble from the railroad-crossings,
and the perpetual sound of the steam-engine
with its shrill whistle, so little in harmony with
pleasure-grounds.</p>

<p>It requires no scientific knowledge, no practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
acquaintance with railroads, to see that those crossings are
a positive nuisance, and that the hospitable park set
apart for the population of a mighty city, and destined
to be one of the most beautiful objects of the civilized
world, actually suffers from the nuisance. I appeal to
Senators who have visited it; I know that there is not
one who will say that I am not right. There is not one
who has ever entered those grounds, not even the Senator
from Pennsylvania who pioneers this bill, that will
not say he regrets those railroad-crossings and wishes
them out of the way. But I shall not rely upon the
authority of the Senator or my own testimony. I have
in my hand the last annual report of the Commissioners,
and I wish the Senate to hear what they say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At an early period of their organization the Commissioners
addressed themselves to the solution of the very difficult
problem of how to attain the best approaches to the Park,
and they have not at any time ceased to give that matter
their earnest attention. If a former generation could have
foreseen”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Now see, Senators, how this applies to the present
case,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If a former generation could have foreseen that the liberal
views which far-sighted men among them held on the
subject of a park which should embrace both banks of the
Schuylkill would finally ripen into a fruition beyond what
the most sanguine could then have dreamed, the great railways
which now run in close proximity to that stream would
have reached the city by other routes, or at least would have
been carried on tracks more remote from the river. At that
day this could readily have been done without conflicting
with any interest; but now that the conditions have been
long established, and trade and travel settled in conformity
to them, any violent change must be regarded as out of the
question.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Commissioners then make certain recommendations,
which I will not take up time to read. But I
come to a brief passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Commissioners, therefore, respectfully but strenuously
urge that steps shall be immediately taken to promote
this most desirable end. And they do this not alone in the
interest of the thousands whose vehicles are entangled at the
railroad-crossing, but much more in the interest of the hundreds
of thousands whose principal enjoyment of the Park has
been and will be in that portion of it which is most exposed
to these dangerous annoyances.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That is testimony. If this were a court of justice
instead of the Senate, and if you, Sir, were a court and
the Senators now before me were a jury, that would be
a testimony conclusive in the case,&mdash;testimony of experts,
who know by experience what they testify, who
have seen with their own eyes and felt in their own
consciousness, whenever they entered that park, the nuisance
against which I now protest. Sir, they testify
against the present bill. Can you answer the testimony?
Is it not clear? Is it not complete?</p>

<p>Sir, I need no testimony. I only ask Senators to look
at the Park. Let them pass through our Library and
take their stand on that unequalled portico from which
they may look down upon an amphitheatre more like
that of ancient Rome than that of any other capital,
with a river beneath and hills in the distance,&mdash;a river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
much larger than the ancient Tiber, and hills much more
beautiful than those that stand about Rome,&mdash;and a
Capitol, too, but how much more beautiful than that
which once gave the law to mankind! Stand on that
portico, Sir, and survey the amphitheatre; your eye
will then rest with satisfaction on the outline of this
very Park, stretching from the Capitol beyond the Executive
Mansion, and destined to be a breathing-place for
the immense population of future generations. Stand
on that portico and try to imagine what this Park may
be.</p>

<p>And now it is proposed not only to diminish that
breathing-place, but to disturb it by the smoke of steam-engines,
and to confuse it by the perpetual din of locomotives.
I hope no such thing will be done. There is
a place for all things; and this I know, the place for a
railway-station is not a public park.</p>

Arbitration as a Substitute for War in determining
Differences between Nations.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whereas by International Law and existing custom
War is recognized as a form of Trial for the
determination of differences between nations; and</p>

<p>Whereas for generations good men have protested
against the irrational character of this arbitrament,
where force instead of justice prevails, and have anxiously
sought for a substitute in the nature of a judicial
tribunal, all of which was expressed by Franklin in his
exclamation, “When will mankind be convinced that
all wars are follies, very expensive and very mischievous,
and agree to settle their differences by Arbitration?”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and</p>

<p>Whereas war once prevailed in the determination of
differences between individuals, between cities, between
counties, and between provinces, being recognized in all
these cases as the arbiter of justice, but at last yielded
to a judicial tribunal, and now, in the progress of civilization,
the time has come for the extension of this humane
principle to nations, so that their differences may
be taken from the arbitrament of war, and, in conformity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with these examples, submitted to a judicial tribunal;
and</p>

<p>Whereas Arbitration has been formally recognized as
a substitute for war in the determination of differences
between nations, being especially recommended by the
Congress of Paris, where were assembled the representatives
of England, France, Russia, Prussia, Austria, Sardinia,
and Turkey, and afterward adopted by the United
States in formal treaty with Great Britain for the determination
of differences arising from depredations of
British cruisers, and also from opposing claims with
regard to the San Juan boundary; and</p>

<p>Whereas it becomes important to consider and settle
the true character of this beneficent tribunal, thus commended
and adopted, so that its authority and completeness
as a substitute for war may not be impaired, but
strengthened and upheld, to the end that civilization
may be advanced and war be limited in its sphere:
Therefore,</p>

<p>1. <i>Resolved</i>, That in the determination of international
differences Arbitration should become a substitute for
war in reality as in name, and therefore coëxtensive with
war in jurisdiction, so that any question or grievance
which might be the occasion of war or of misunderstanding
between nations should be considered by this
tribunal.</p>

<p>2. <i>Resolved</i>, That any withdrawal from a treaty recognizing
Arbitration, or any refusal to abide the judgment
of the accepted tribunal, or any interposition of
technicalities to limit the proceedings, is to this extent
a disparagement of the tribunal as a substitute for war,
and therefore hostile to civilization.</p>

<p>3. <i>Resolved</i>, That the United States, having at heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the cause of peace everywhere, and hoping to help its

<p>The Sundry Civil Appropriation Bill coming up as unfinished business,
Mr. Sumner moved to postpone indefinitely its consideration,
and after remarking on the Report of the Committee on the Sale of
Arms to French Agents, he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I have no hesitation in declaring
myself a member of the Republican
Party, and one of the straitest of the sect. I doubt if
any Senator can point to earlier or more constant service
in its behalf. I began at the beginning, and from
that early day have never failed to sustain its candidates
and to advance its principles. For these I have
labored always by speech and vote, in the Senate and
elsewhere,&mdash;at first with few only, but at last, as success
began to dawn, then with multitudes flocking forward.
In this cause I never asked who were my associates
or how many they would number. In the
consciousness of right I was willing to be alone. To
such a party, with which so much of my life is intertwined,
I have no common attachment. Not without
regret can I see it suffer; not without a pang can I see
it changed from its original character, for such a change
is death. Therefore do I ask, with no common feeling,
that the peril which menaces it may pass away. I stood
by its cradle; let me not follow its hearse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<h4>ORIGIN AND OBJECT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.</h4>

<p>Turning back to its birth, I recall a speech of my
own at a State Convention in Massachusetts, as early as
September 7, 1854, where I vindicated its principles
and announced its name in these words: “As <i>Republicans</i>
we go forth to encounter the <i>Oligarchs</i> of Slavery.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The report records the applause with which
this name was received by the excited multitude. Years
of conflict ensued, in which the good cause constantly
gained. At last, in the spring of 1860, Abraham Lincoln
was nominated by this party as its candidate for
the Presidency; and here pardon me, if I refer again to
myself. On my way home from the Senate I was detained
in New York by the invitation of party friends
to speak at the Cooper Institute on the issues of the
pending election. The speech was made July 11, and,
I believe, was the earliest of the campaign. As published
at the time, it was entitled “Origin, Necessity,
and Permanence of the Republican Party,” and to exhibit
these was its precise object. Both the necessity
and permanence of the party were asserted. A brief
passage, which I take from the report in the “New York
Herald,” will show the duty and destiny I ventured
then to hold up. After dwelling on the evils of Slavery
and the corruptions it had engendered, including the
purchase of votes at the polls, I proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Therefore, just so long as the present false theories of Slavery
prevail, whether concerning its character morally, economically,
and socially, or concerning its prerogatives under the
Constitution, just so long as the Slave Oligarchy, which is the
sleepless and unhesitating agent of Slavery in all its pretensions,
continues to exist as a political power, the Republican
Party must endure. [<i>Applause.</i>] If bad men conspire for
Slavery, good men must combine for Freedom. [‘<i>Good!
good!</i>’] Nor can the Holy War be ended until the barbarism
now dominant in the Republic is overthrown, and the Pagan
power is driven from our Jerusalem. [<i>Applause.</i>] And when
this triumph is won, securing the immediate object of our organization,
the Republican Party will not die, but, purified
by its long contest with Slavery and filled with higher life, it
will be lifted to yet other efforts and with nobler aims for the
good of man. [<i>Applause, with three cheers for Lincoln.</i>]”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such, on the eve of the Presidential election, was my
description of the Republican Party and my aspiration
for its future. It was not to die, but, “purified by its long
contest with Slavery and filled with higher life,” we were
to behold it “lifted to yet other efforts and with nobler
aims for the good of man.” Here was nothing personal,
nothing mean or petty. The Republican Party was necessary
and permanent, and always on an ascending
plane. For such a party there was no death, but higher
life and nobler aims; and this was the party to which I
gave my vows. But, alas, how changed! Once country
was the object, and not a man; once principle was inscribed
on the victorious banners, and not a name only.</p>

<h4>THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SEIZED BY THE PRESIDENT.</h4>

<p>It is not difficult to indicate when this disastrous
change, exalting the will of one man above all else, became
not merely manifest, but painfully conspicuous.
Already it had begun to show itself in personal pretensions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
to which I shall refer soon, when, suddenly and
without any warning through the public press or any
expression from public opinion, the President elected by
the Republican Party precipitated upon the country an
ill-considered and ill-omened scheme for the annexion
of a portion of the island of San Domingo, in pursuance
of a treaty negotiated by a person of his own household
styling himself “Aide-de-Camp to the President of the
United States.” Had this effort, however injudicious
in object, been confined to ordinary and constitutional
proceedings, with proper regard for a coördinate branch
of the Government, it would have soon dropped out of
sight and been remembered only as a blunder. But it
was not so. Strangely and unaccountably, it was pressed
for months by every means and appliance of power,
whether at home or abroad, now reaching into the Senate
Chamber, and now into the waters about the island.
Reluctant Senators were subdued to its support, while,
treading under foot the Constitution in one of its most
distinctive republican principles, the President seized
the war powers of the nation, instituted foreign intervention,
and capped the climax of usurpation by menace
of violence to the Black Republic of Hayti, where
the colored race have begun the experiment of self-government,&mdash;thus
adding manifest outrage of International
Law to manifest outrage of the Constitution,
while the long-suffering African was condemned to new
indignity. All these things, so utterly indefensible and
aggravating, and therefore to be promptly disowned,
found defenders on this floor. The President who was
the original author of the wrongs continued to maintain
them, and appealed to Republican Senators for help,&mdash;thus
fulfilling the eccentric stipulation with the Government
of Baez executed by his Aide-de-Camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>At last a Republican Senator, who felt it his duty to
exhibit these plain violations of the Constitution and of
International Law, and then in obedience to the irresistible
promptings of his nature and in harmony with
his whole life pleaded for the equal rights of the Black
Republic, who declared that he did this as a Republican
and to save the party from this wretched complicity,&mdash;this
Republican Senator, engaged in a patriotic service,
and anxious to save the colored people from outrage,
was denounced on this floor as a traitor to the party;
and this was done by a Senator speaking for the party,
and known to be in intimate relations with the President
guilty of these wrongs. Evidently the party was in process
of change from that generous association dedicated
to Human Rights and to the guardianship of the African
race. Too plainly it was becoming the instrument of
<i>one man and his personal will</i>,&mdash;no matter how much
he set at defiance the Constitution and International
Law, or how much he insulted the colored people. The
President was to be maintained at all hazards, notwithstanding
his aberrations, and all who called them in
question were to be struck down.</p>

<p>In exhibiting this autocratic pretension, so revolutionary
and unrepublican in character, I mean to be moderate
in language and to keep within the strictest bounds.
The facts are indisputable, and nobody can deny the
gross violation of the Constitution and of International
Law with insult to the Black Republic,&mdash;the whole
case being more reprehensible, as also plainly more unconstitutional
and more illegal, than anything alleged
against Andrew Johnson on his impeachment. Believe
me, Sir, I should gladly leave this matter to the judgment
already recorded, if it were not put in issue again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
by the extraordinary efforts, radiating on every line of
office, to press its author for a second term as President;
and since silence gives consent, all these efforts are his
efforts. They become more noteworthy when it is considered
that the name of the candidate thus pressed has
become a sign of discord and not of concord, dividing
instead of uniting the Republican Party, so that these
extraordinary efforts tend directly to the disruption of
the party,&mdash;all of which he witnesses, and again by his
silence ratifies. “Let the party split,” says the President,
“I will not renounce my chance of a second
term.” The extent of this personal pressure and the
subordination of the party to the will of an individual
compel us to consider his pretensions. These, too, are
in issue.</p>

<h4>PRESIDENTIAL PRETENSIONS.</h4>

<p>“Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,” that he
should assume so much? No honor for victory in war
can justify disobedience to the Constitution and to Law;
nor can it afford the least apology for any personal immunity,
privilege, or license in the Presidential office.
A President must turn into a King before it can be said
of him that he can do no wrong. He is responsible always.
As President he is foremost servant of the Law,
bound to obey its slightest mandate. As the elect of
the people he owes not only the example of willing obedience,
but also of fidelity and industry in the discharge
of his exalted office, with an absolute abnegation of all
self-seeking. Nothing for self, but all for country. And
now, as we regard the career of this candidate, we find
to our amazement how little it accords with this simple
requirement. Bring it to the touchstone and it fails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only are Constitution and Law disregarded, but
the Presidential office itself is treated as little more than
a plaything and a perquisite,&mdash;when not the former,
then the latter. Here the details are ample, showing
how from the beginning this august trust has dropped to
be a personal indulgence, where palace-cars, fast horses,
and seaside loiterings figure more than duties; how
personal aims and objects have been more prominent
than the public interest; how the Presidential office has
been used to advance his own family on a scale of nepotism
dwarfing everything of the kind in our history, and
hardly equalled in the corrupt governments where this
abuse has most prevailed; how in the same spirit office
has been conferred upon those from whom he had received
gifts or benefits, thus making the country repay
his personal obligations; how personal devotion to himself,
rather than public or party service, has been made
the standard of favor; how the vast appointing power
conferred by the Constitution for the general welfare has
been employed at his will to promote his schemes, to
reward his friends, to punish his opponents, and to advance
his election to a second term; how all these assumptions
have matured in a <i>personal government</i>, semi-military
in character and breathing the military spirit,&mdash;being
a species of Cæsarism or <i>personalism</i>, abhorrent to
republican institutions, where subservience to the President
is the supreme law; how in maintaining this subservience
he has operated by a system of combinations,
military, political, and even senatorial, having their orbits
about him, so that, like the planet Saturn, he is surrounded
by rings,&mdash;nor does the similitude end here, for
his rings, like those of the planet, are held in position
by satellites; how this utterly unrepublican Cæsarism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
has mastered the Republican Party and dictated the
Presidential will, stalking into the Senate Chamber itself,
while a vindictive spirit visits good Republicans
who cannot submit; how the President himself, unconscious
that a President has no right to quarrel with
anybody, insists upon quarrelling until he has become
the great Presidential quarreller, with more quarrels
than all other Presidents together, all begun and continued
by himself; how his personal followers back him in
quarrels, insult those he insults, and then, not departing
from his spirit, cry out, with Shakespeare, “We will
have <i>rings</i> and things and fine array”; and, finally, how
the chosen head of the Republic is known chiefly for
Presidential pretensions, utterly indefensible in character,
derogatory to the country, and of evil influence,
making personal objects a primary pursuit, so that,
instead of a beneficent presence, he is a bad example,
through whom republican institutions suffer and the
people learn to do wrong.</p>

<p>Would that these things could be forgotten! but since
through officious friends the President insists upon a
second term, they must be considered and publicly discussed.
When understood, nobody will vindicate them.
It is easy to see that Cæsarism even in Europe is at a
discount, that “personal government” has been beaten
on that ancient field, and that “Cæsar with a Senate at
his heels” is not the fit model for our Republic. King
George the Third of England, so peculiar for narrowness
and obstinacy, had retainers in Parliament who went
under the name of “The King’s Friends.” Nothing can
be allowed here to justify the inquiry, “Have we a King
George among us?”&mdash;or that other question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> “Have
we a party in the Senate of ‘The King’s Friends’?”</p>

<h4>PERSONAL GOVERNMENT UNREPUBLICAN.</h4>

<p>Personal Government is autocratic. It is the One-Man
Power elevated above all else, and is therefore in
direct conflict with republican government, whose consummate
form is tripartite, being executive, legislative,
and judicial,&mdash;each independent and coëqual. From
Mr. Madison, in “The Federalist,” we learn that the accumulation
of these powers “in the same hands” may
justly be pronounced “the very definition of Tyranny.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
And so any attempt by either to exercise the powers of
another is a tyrannical invasion, always reprehensible in
proportion to its extent. John Adams tells us, in most
instructive words, that “it is by balancing each of these
powers against the other two that the efforts in human
nature towards tyranny can alone be checked and restrained,
and any degree of freedom preserved in the
Constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Then, again, the same authority says that the perfection
of this great idea is “by giving each division a
power to defend itself by a negative.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In other words,
each is armed against invasion by the others. Accordingly,
the Constitution of Virginia, in 1776, famous as
an historical precedent, declared expressly: “The legislative,
executive, and judiciary departments shall be
separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers
properly belonging to the other; nor shall any person
exercise the powers of more than one of them at the
same time.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>The Constitution of Massachusetts, dating from 1780,
embodied the same principle in memorable words: “In
the government of this Commonwealth, the legislative
department shall never exercise the executive and judicial
powers, or either of them; the executive shall never
exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of
them; the judicial shall never exercise the legislative
and executive powers, or either of them: to the end it
may be a government of laws and not of men.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>A government of laws and not of men is the object of
republican government; nay, more, it is the distinctive
essence without which it becomes a tyranny. Therefore
personal government in all its forms, and especially
when it seeks to sway the action of any other branch or
overturn its constitutional negative, is hostile to the first
principles of republican institutions, and an unquestionable
outrage. That our President has offended in this
way is unhappily too apparent.</p>

<h4>THE PRESIDENT AS A CIVILIAN.</h4>

<p>To comprehend the personal government that has
been installed over us we must know its author. His
picture is the necessary frontispiece,&mdash;not as soldier,
let it be borne in mind, but as civilian. The President
is titular head of the Army and Navy of the United
States, but his office is not military or naval. As if
to exclude all question, he is classed by the Constitution
among “civil officers.” Therefore as civilian is he to be
seen. Then, perhaps, may we learn the secret of the policy
so adverse to republicanism in which he perseveres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>To appreciate his peculiar character as a civilian it is
important to know his triumphs as a soldier, for the one
is the natural complement of the other. The successful
soldier is rarely changed to the successful civilian. There
seems an incompatibility between the two, modified by
the extent to which one has been allowed to exclude
the other. One always a soldier cannot late in life become
a statesman; one always a civilian cannot late in
life become a soldier. Education and experience are
needed for each. Washington and Jackson were civilians
as well as soldiers.</p>

<p>In the large training and experience of Antiquity the
soldier and civilian were often united; but in modern
times this has been seldom. The camp is peculiar in
the influence it exercises; it is in itself an education;
but it is not the education of the statesman. To suppose
that we can change without preparation from the
soldier to the statesman is to assume that training and
experience are of less consequence for the one than the
other,&mdash;that a man may be born a statesman, but can
fit himself as a soldier only by four years at West Point,
careful scientific study, the command of troops, and experience
in the tented field. And is nothing required
for the statesman? Is his duty so slight? His study is
the nation and its welfare, turning always to history for
example, to law for authority, and to the loftiest truth
for rules of conduct. No knowledge, care, or virtue,
disciplined by habit, can be too great. The pilot is not
accepted in his trust until he knows the signs of the
storm, the secrets of navigation, the rocks of the coast,&mdash;all
of which are learned only by careful study with charts
and soundings, by coasting the land and watching the
crested wave. But can less be expected of that other
pilot who is to steer the ship which contains us all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>The failure of the modern soldier as statesman is exhibited
by Mr. Buckle in his remarkable work on the
“History of Civilization.” Writing as a philosopher devoted
to liberal ideas, he does not disguise that in Antiquity
“the most eminent soldiers were likewise the most
eminent politicians”; but he plainly shows the reason
when he adds, that “in the midst of the hurry and turmoil
of camps these eminent men cultivated their minds
to the highest point that the knowledge of that age
would allow.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The secret was culture not confined to
war. In modern Europe few soldiers have been more
conspicuous than Gustavus Adolphus and Frederick
sometimes called the Great; but we learn from our
author that both “failed ignominiously in their domestic
policy, and showed themselves as short-sighted in the
arts of peace as they were sagacious in the arts of war.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
The judgment of Marlborough is more pointed. While
portraying him as “the greatest conqueror of his age,
the hero of a hundred fights, the victor of Blenheim and
of Ramillies,” the same philosophical writer adds that
he was “a man not only of the most idle and frivolous
pursuits, but was so miserably ignorant that his deficiencies
made him the ridicule of his contemporaries,”
while his politics were compounded of selfishness and
treachery.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Nor was Wellington an exception. Though
shining in the field without a rival, and remarkable for
integrity of purpose, an unflinching honesty, and high
moral feeling, the conqueror of Waterloo is described as
“nevertheless utterly unequal to the complicated exigencies
of political life.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This judgment of the philosopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
is confirmed by that of Metternich, the renowned
statesman, who, after encountering Wellington at the
Congresses of Vienna and Verona, did not hesitate to
write of him as “the great Baby.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Such are the examples
of history, each with its warning.</p>

<p>It would be hard to find anything in the native endowments
or in the training of our chieftain to make
him an illustrious exception; at least nothing of this
kind is recorded. Was Nature more generous with him
than with Marlborough or Wellington, Gustavus Adolphus
or Frederick called the Great? or was his experience
of life a better preparation than theirs? And yet
they failed, except in war. It is not known that our
chieftain had any experience as a civilian until he became
President, nor does any partisan attribute to him
that double culture which in Antiquity made the same
man soldier and statesman. It has often been said that
he took no note of public affairs, never voting but once
in his life, and then for James Buchanan. After leaving
West Point he became a captain in the Army, but
soon abandoned the service, to reappear at a later day
as a successful general. There is no reason to believe
that he employed this intermediate period in any way
calculated to improve him as a statesman. One of his
unhesitating supporters, my colleague, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>,] in
a speech intended to commend him for reëlection, says:
“Before the war we knew nothing of Grant. He was
earning a few hundred dollars a year in tanning hides
in Galena.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> By the war he passed to be President;
and such was his preparation to govern the Great Republic,
making it an example to mankind! Thus he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
learned to deal with all questions, domestic and foreign,
whether of peace or war, to declare Constitutional Law
and International Law, and to administer the vast appointing
power, creating Cabinet officers, judges, foreign
ministers, and an uncounted army of office-holders!</p>

<p>To these things must be added, that when this soldier
first began as civilian he was already forty-six years old.
At this mature age, close upon half a century, when habits
are irrevocably fixed, when the mind has hardened
against what is new, when the character has taken its
permanent form, and the whole man is rooted in his own
unchangeable individuality, our soldier entered abruptly
upon the untried life of a civilian in its most exalted
sphere. Do not be surprised, that, like other soldiers,
he failed; the wonder would be had he succeeded.
There is a French saying, that at forty a man has given
his measure. At least his vocation is settled,&mdash;how
completely is seen, if we suppose the statesman, after
traversing the dividing point, abruptly changed to the
soldier. And yet at an age nearly seven years later our
soldier precipitately changed to the statesman.</p>

<p>This sudden metamorphosis cannot be forgotten, when
we seek to comprehend the strange pretensions which
ensued. It is easy to see how some very moderate experience
in civil life, involving of course the lesson of
subordination to republican principles, would have prevented
indefensible acts.</p>

<h4>TESTIMONY OF THE LATE EDWIN M. STANTON.</h4>

<p>Something also must be attributed to individual character.
And here I express no opinion of my own; I
shall allow another to speak in solemn words echoed
from the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching Washington at the opening of Congress
in December, 1869, I was pained to hear that Mr. Stanton,
lately Secretary of War, was in failing health. Full
of gratitude for his unsurpassed services, and with a
sentiment of friendship quickened by common political
sympathies, I lost no time in seeing him, and repeated
my visits until his death, toward the close of the same
month. My last visit was marked by a communication
never to be forgotten. As I entered his bedroom, where
I found him reclining on a sofa, propped by pillows, he
reached out his hand, already clammy cold, and in reply
to my inquiry, “How are you?” answered, “Waiting
for my furlough.” Then at once, with singular solemnity,
he said, “I have something to say to you.” When
I was seated, he proceeded without one word of introduction:
“I know General Grant better than any other
person in the country can know him. It was my duty
to study him, and I did so night and day, when I saw him
and when I did not see him; and now I tell you what
I know: <i>he cannot govern this country</i>.” The intensity
of his manner and the positiveness of his judgment surprised
me; for, though I was aware that the late Secretary
of War did not place the President very high in general
capacity, I was not prepared for a judgment so strongly
couched. At last, after some delay, occupied in meditating
his remarkable words, I observed, “What you say
is very broad.” “It is as true as it is broad,” he replied
promptly. I added, “You are tardy; you tell this late:
why did you not say it before his nomination?” He
answered, that he was not consulted about the nomination,
and had no opportunity of expressing his opinion
upon it, besides being much occupied at the time by his
duties as Secretary of War and his contest with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
President. I followed by saying, “But you took part in
the Presidential election, and made a succession of
speeches for him in Ohio and Pennsylvania.” “I
spoke,” said he, “but I never introduced the name of
General Grant. I spoke for the Republican Party and
the Republican cause.” This was the last time I saw
Mr. Stanton. A few days later I followed him to the
grave where he now rests. As the vagaries of the President
became more manifest, and the Presidential office
seemed more and more a plaything and perquisite, this
dying judgment of the great citizen who knew him so
well haunted me constantly, day and night; and I now
communicate it to my country, feeling that it is a legacy
which I have no right to withhold. Beyond the intrinsic
interest from its author, it is not without value as testimony
in considering how the President could have been
led into that Quixotism of personal pretension which it
is my duty to expose.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<h4>DUTY TO MAKE EXPOSURE.</h4>

<p>Pardon me, if I repeat that it is my duty to make
this exposure, spreading before you the proofs of that
personal government, which will only pass without censure
when it passes without observation. Insisting upon
reëlection, the President challenges inquiry and puts
himself upon the country. But even if his pressure for
reëlection did not menace the tranquillity of the country,
it is important that the personal pretensions he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
set up should be exposed, that no President hereafter
may venture upon such ways, and no Senator presume
to defend them. The case is clear as noon.</p>

<h4>TWO TYPICAL INSTANCES.</h4>

<p>In opening this catalogue I select two typical instances,&mdash;Nepotism,
and Gift-Taking with repayment
by office, each absolutely indefensible in the head of a
Republic, most pernicious in example, and showing beyond
question that surpassing egotism which changed
the Presidential office into a personal instrumentality,
not unlike the trunk of an elephant, apt for all things,
small as well as great, from provision for a relation to
forcing a treaty on a reluctant Senate, or forcing a reëlection
on a reluctant people.</p>

<h4>NEPOTISM OF THE PRESIDENT.</h4>

<p>Between these two typical instances I hesitate which
to place foremost: but since the nepotism of the President
is a ruling passion, revealing the primary instincts
of his nature,&mdash;since it is maintained by him in utter
unconsciousness of its offensive character,&mdash;since, instead
of blushing for it as an unhappy mistake, he continues
to uphold it,&mdash;since it has been openly defended
by Senators on this floor,&mdash;and since no true patriot
anxious for republican institutions can doubt that it
ought to be driven with hissing and scorn from all possibility
of repetition,&mdash;I begin with this undoubted
abuse.</p>

<p>There has been no call of Congress for a return of the
relations holding office, stipend, or money-making opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
under the President. The country is left to
the press for information on this important subject. If
there is any exaggeration, the President is in fault,&mdash;since,
knowing the discreditable allegations, he has not
hastened to furnish the precise facts, or at least his partisans
have failed in not calling for the official information.
In the mood which they have shown in this
Chamber, it is evident that any resolution calling for it,
moved by a Senator not known to be for his reëlection,
would meet with opposition, and an effort to vindicate
republican institutions would be denounced as an assault
on the President. But the newspapers have placed
enough beyond question for judgment on this extraordinary
case, although thus far there has been no attempt
to appreciate it, especially in the light of history.</p>

<p>One list makes the number of beneficiaries as many
as forty-two, being probably every known person allied
to the President by blood or marriage. Persons seeming
to speak for the President, or at least after careful
inquiries, have denied the accuracy of this list, reducing
it to thirteen. It will not be questioned that there is at
least a baker’s dozen in this category,&mdash;thirteen relations
of the President billeted on the country, not one
of whom but for this relationship would have been
brought forward, the whole constituting a case of nepotism
not unworthy of those worst governments where
office is a family possession.</p>

<p>Beyond the list of thirteen are other revelations, showing
that this strange abuse did not stop with the President’s
relations, but that these obtained appointments
for others in their circle,&mdash;so that every relation became
a centre of influence, while the Presidential family
extended indefinitely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Hitherto only one President has appointed relations,
and that was John Adams; but he found public opinion,
inspired by the example of Washington, so strong against
it, that, after a slight experiment, he replied to an applicant,
“You know it is impossible for me to appoint my
own relations to anything, without drawing forth a torrent
of obloquy.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The judgment of the country found
voice in Thomas Jefferson, who, in a letter written shortly
after he became President, used these strong words:
“Mr. Adams <i>degraded himself infinitely</i> by his conduct
on this subject.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> But John Adams, besides transferring
his son John Quincy Adams from one diplomatic post
to another, appointed only two relations. Pray, Sir, what
words would Jefferson use, if he were here to speak on
the open and multifarious nepotism of our President?</p>

<h4>ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF NEPOTISM.</h4>

<p>The Presidential pretension is so important in every
aspect, and the character of republican institutions is so
absolutely compromised by its toleration, that it cannot
be treated in any perfunctory way. It shall not be my
fault, if hereafter there is any doubt with regard to it.</p>

<p>The word “Nepotism” is of Italian origin. First appearing
at Rome when the Papal power was at its height,
it served to designate the authority and influence exercised
by the nephews, or more generally the family, of
a Pope: all the family of a Pope were nephews, and the
Pope was universal uncle. From Italian the word passed
into other European languages, but in the lapse of time
or process of naturalization it has come to denote the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
misconduct of the appointing power, and has amplified
so as to embrace others besides Popes who appoint relations
to office. Johnson in his Dictionary defines it
simply as “Fondness for nephews”; but our latest and
best lexicographer, Worcester, supplies a definition more
complete and satisfactory: “Favoritism shown to relations;
patronage bestowed <i>in consideration of family relationship
and not of merit</i>.” Such undoubtedly is the
meaning of the word as now received and employed.</p>

<p>The character of this pretension appears in its origin
and history. As far back as 1667 this undoubted abuse
occupied attention to such a degree that it became the
subject of an able historical work, entitled “Il Nipotismo
di Roma,” which is full of instruction and warning even
for our Republic. In the early days of the Church Popes
are described as discarding all relationship, whether of
blood or alliance, and inclining to merit alone in their
appointments, although there were some with so large
a number of nephews, grand-nephews, brothers-in-law,
and relations, as to baffle belief; and yet it is recorded
that no sooner did the good Pope enter the Vatican,
which is the Executive Mansion of Rome, than relations
fled, brothers-in-law hid themselves, grand-nephews removed
away, and nephews got at a long distance.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Such
was the early virtue. Nepotism did not exist, and the
word itself was unknown.</p>

<p>At last, in 1471, twenty-one years before the discovery
of America by Columbus, Sixtus the Fourth became
Pope, and with him began that nepotism which
soon became famous as a Roman institution.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Born
in 1414, the son of a fisherman, the eminent founder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
was already fifty-seven years old, and he reigned thirteen
years, bringing to his functions large experience as
a successful preacher and as general of the Franciscan
friars. Though cradled in poverty, and by the vows of
his Order bound to mendicancy, he began at once to
heap office and riches upon the various members of his
family, so that his conduct, from its barefaced inconsistency
with the obligation of his life, excited, according
to the historian, “the amazement and wonder of
all.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The useful reforms he attempted are forgotten,
and this remarkable pontiff is chiefly remembered now
as the earliest nepotist. Different degrees of severity
are employed by different authors in characterizing this
unhappy fame. Bouillet, in his Dictionary of History,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
having Catholic approbation, describes him as “feeble
toward his nephews”; and our own Cyclopædia,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> in a
brief exposition of his character, says “he made himself
odious by excessive nepotism.” But in all varieties of
expression the offence stands out for judgment.</p>

<p>The immediate successor of Sixtus was Innocent the
Eighth, whom the historian describes as “very cold to
his relations,”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> since three only obtained preferment at
his hands. But the example of the founder so far prevailed
that for a century nepotism, as was said, “lorded
it in Rome,”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> except in a few instances worthy of commemoration
and example.</p>

<p>Of these exceptions, the first in time was Julius the
Second, founder of St. Peter’s at Rome, whose remarkable
countenance is so beautifully preserved by the genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of Rafael. Though the nephew of the nepotist, and not
declining to appoint all relations, he did it with such
moderation that Rome was said to have been “almost
without nepotism” in his time.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Adrian the Sixth,
early teacher of Charles the Fifth, and successor of Leo
the Tenth, set a better example by refusing absolutely;
but so accustomed had Rome become to this abuse, that
not only the ambassadors, but the people, condemned
him as “too rude” with his relations. A son of his
cousin, studying in Siena, started for Rome, trusting to
obtain important recognition; but the Pope, without
seeing him, sent him back on a hired horse. Relations
thronged from other places, and even from across the
Alps, longing for that greatness which other Popes had
lavished on family; but Adrian dismissed them with a
slight change of clothing and an allowance of money for
the journey: one who from poverty came on foot was
permitted to return on foot. This Pope carried abnegation
of his family so far as to make relationship an excuse
for not rewarding one who had served the Church
well.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Similar in character was Marcellus the Second,
who became Pope in 1555. He was unwilling that any
of his family should come to Rome; even his brother
was forbidden: but this good example was closed by
death, after a reign of twenty days only; and yet this
brief period of exemplary virtue has made this pontiff
famous. Kindred in spirit was Urban the Seventh, who
reigned thirteen days only in 1590, but long enough to
repel his relations,&mdash;and also Leo the Eleventh, who
reigned twenty-five days in 1605. To this list may be
added Innocent the Ninth, who died after two months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of service. It is related that his death displeased his
relations much, and dissolved the air-castles they had
built. They had hurried from Bologna, but, except a
grand-nephew, all were obliged to return poor as they
came.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In this list I must not forget Pius the Fifth,
who reigned from 1566 to 1572. He set himself so
completely against aggrandizing his own family, that he
was with difficulty persuaded to make a sister’s son cardinal,&mdash;and
would not have done it, had not all the
cardinals united, on grounds of conscience, against the
denial of this dignity to one most worthy of it.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Such
virtue was part of that elevated character which caused
his subsequent canonization.</p>

<p>These good Popes were short-lived,&mdash;their reigns for
the most part counting by days only; but they opened
happy glimpses of an administration where the powers
of government were not treated as a personal perquisite.
The opposite list had the advantage of time.</p>

<p>Conspicuous among nepotists was Alexander the Sixth,
whose family name of Borgia is damned to fame. With
him nepotism assumed its most brutal and barbarous development,
reflecting the character of its pontifical author,
who was without the smallest ray of good. Other
Popes were less cruel and bloody, but not less determined
in providing for their families. Paul the Third, who was
of the great house of Farnese, would have had the estates
of the Church a garden for the “lilies” which flourish
on the escutcheon of his family.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It is related that
when Urban the Eighth, who was a Barberini, began his
historic reign, all his relations at a distance flew to Rome
like the “bees” on the family arms, to suck the honey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of the Church, but not leaving behind the sting with
which they pricked while they sucked.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Whether lilies
or bees, it was the same. The latter pontiff gave to nepotism
fulness of power when he resolved “to have no
business with any one not dependent upon his house.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
In the same spirit he excused himself from making a
man cardinal because he had “always been the enemy
of his nephews.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Although nothing so positive is recorded
of Paul the Fifth, who was a Borghese, his nepotism
appears in the Roman saying, that, “while serving
the Church as a good shepherd, he gave too much wool
to his nephews.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> These instructive incidents, illustrating
the pontifical pretension, reflect light on the history
of palaces and galleries at Rome, now admired by the
visitor from distant lands. If not created, they were at
least enlarged by nepotism.</p>

<p>It does not always appear how many relations a Pope
endowed. Often it was all, as in the case of Gregory
the Thirteenth, who, besides advancing a nephew actually
at Rome, called thither all his nephews and grand-nephews,
whether from brothers or sisters, and gave
them offices, dignities, governments, lordships, prelacies,
and abbacies.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Cæsar Borgia and his sister Lucretia
were not the only relations of Alexander the Sixth. I
do not find the number adopted by Sixtus, the founder
of the system. Pius the Fourth, who was of the grasping
Medicean family, favored no less than twenty-five.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Alexander the Seventh, of the Chigi family, had about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
him five nephews and one brother, which a contemporary
characterized as “nepotism all complete.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This
pontiff began his reign by forbidding his relations to
appear at Rome, which redounded at once to his credit
throughout the Christian world, while the astonished
people discoursed of his holiness and the purity of his
life, expecting even to see miracles. In making the
change, he yielded evidently to immoral pressure and
the example of predecessors.</p>

<p>The performances of papal nephews figure in history.
After the Borgias were the Caraffas, who obtained power
through Paul the Fourth; but at last becoming too insolent
and rapacious, their uncle was compelled to strip
them of their dignities and drive them from Rome.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Sometimes nephews were employed chiefly in ministering
to pontifical pleasures, as in the case of Julius
the Third, who, according to the historian, “thought
of nothing but banqueting with this one and that one,
keeping his relations in Rome rather to accompany him
at banquets than to aid him in the government of the
holy Church, about which he thought little.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> This
occasion for relations does not exist at Rome now, as the
pontiff leads a discreet life, always at home, and never
banquets abroad.</p>

<p>These historic instances make us see nepotism in its
original seat. Would you know how it was regarded
there? Sometimes it was called a hydra with many
heads, sprouting anew at the election of a pontiff,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
then again it was called Ottoman rather than Christian
in character.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The contemporary historian who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
described it so minutely says that those who merely read
of it without seeing it will find it difficult to believe or
even imagine.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The qualities of a Pope’s relation were
said to be “ignorance and cunning.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> It is easy to believe
that this prostitution of the head of the Church was
one of the abuses which excited the cry for Reform, and
awakened even in Rome the echoes of Martin Luther.
A Swedish nobleman visiting Rome is recorded as declaring
himself unwilling to be the subject of a pontiff
who was himself the subject of his own relations.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> But
even this pretension was not without open defenders,
while the general effrontery with which it was maintained
assumed that it was above question. If some
gave with eyes closed, most gave with eyes open. It
was said that Popes were not to neglect their own blood,
that they should not show themselves worse than the
beasts, not one of which fails to caress its relations; and
the case of bears and lions, the most ferocious of all, was
cited as authority for this recognition of one’s own blood.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
All this was soberly said, and it is doubtless true. Not
even a Pope can justly neglect his own blood; but help
and charity must be at his own expense, and not at the
expense of his country. In appointments to office, merit
and not blood is the only just recommendation.</p>

<p>That nepotism has ceased to lord itself in Rome, that
no pontiff billets his relations upon the Church, that
the appointing power of the Pope is treated as a public
trust and not as a personal perquisite,&mdash;all this is the
present testimony with regard to that government which
knows from experience the baneful character of this
abuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<h4>AMERICAN AUTHORITIES ON NEPOTISM.</h4>

<p>The nepotism of Rome was little known in our country,
and I do not doubt that Washington, when declining
to make the Presidential office a personal perquisite,
was governed by that instinct of duty and patriotism
which rendered him so preëminent. Through all the
perils of a seven years’ war he had battled with that
kingly rule which elevates a whole family without regard
to merit, fastening all upon the nation, and he had
learned that this royal system could find no place in a
republic. Therefore he rejected the claims of relations,
and in nothing was his example more beautiful. His
latest biographer, Washington Irving, records him as
saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So far as I know my own mind, I would not be in the remotest
degree influenced in making nominations by motives
arising from the ties of family or blood.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again he declared his purpose to “discharge the
duties of the office with that impartiality and zeal for
the public good which ought never to suffer connections
of blood or friendship to intermingle so as to have the
least sway on decisions of a public nature.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>This excellent rule of conduct is illustrated by the
advice to his successor with regard to the promotion of
his son, John Quincy Adams. After giving it as his
“decided opinion” that the latter “is the most valuable
public character we have abroad,” and promises to be
“the ablest of all our diplomatic corps,” Washington
declares:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If he was now to be brought into that line, or into any
other public walk, I could not, upon the principle which has
regulated my own conduct, disapprove of the caution which
is hinted at in the letter.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Considering the importance of the rule, it were better
for the country if it had prevailed over parental regard
and the extraordinary merits of the son.</p>

<p>In vindicating his conduct at a later day, John Adams
protested against what he called “the hypersuperlative
public virtue” of Washington, and insisted: “A President
ought not to appoint a man because he is his relation;
nor ought he to refuse or neglect to appoint him
for that reason.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> With absolute certainty that the
President is above all prejudice of family and sensitive
to merit only, this rule is not unreasonable; but who
can be trusted to apply it?</p>

<p>Jefferson developed and explained the true principles in
a manner worthy of republican institutions. In a letter to
a relation immediately after becoming President, he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The public will never be made to believe that an appointment
of a relative is made on the ground of merit alone,
uninfluenced by family views; <i>nor can they ever see with approbation
offices, the disposal of which they intrust to their Presidents
for public purposes, divided out as family property</i>.
Mr. Adams degraded himself infinitely by his conduct on
this subject, as General Washington had done himself the
greatest honor. With two such examples to proceed by, I
should be doubly inexcusable to err.”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

</div>

<p>After his retirement from the Presidency, in a letter
to a kinsman, he asserts the rule again:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Towards acquiring the confidence of the people, the
very first measure is to satisfy them of his disinterestedness,
and that he is directing their affairs with a single eye to their
good, and not to build up fortunes for himself and family;
and especially that the officers appointed to transact their
business are appointed because they are the fittest men, not
because they are his relations. So prone are they to suspicion,
that, where a President appoints a relation of his own,
however worthy, they will believe that favor, and not merit,
was the motive. I therefore laid it down as a law of conduct
for myself, never to give an appointment to a relation.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

</div>

<p>That statement is unanswerable. The elect of the
people must live so as best to maintain their interests
and to elevate the national sentiment. This can be only
by an example of unselfish devotion to the public weal
which shall be above suspicion. A President suspected
of weakness for his relations is already shorn of strength.</p>

<p>In saying that his predecessor “degraded himself infinitely
by his conduct on this subject,” Jefferson shows
the rigor of his requirement. Besides the transfer of his
son, John Quincy Adams, from one diplomatic mission
of lower grade to another of a higher, John Adams is responsible
for the appointment of his son-in-law, Colonel
Smith, as surveyor of the port of New York, and his
wife’s nephew, William Cranch, as chief-justice of the
Circuit Court of the District of Columbia,&mdash;both persons
of merit, and the former “serving through the war
with high applause of his superiors.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The public sentiment
appears in the condemnation of these appointments.
In refusing another of his relations, we have
already seen<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> that John Adams wrote:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> “You know it is
impossible for me to appoint my own relations to anything
without drawing forth a torrent of obloquy.” But
this torrent was nothing but the judgment of the American
people unwilling that republican institutions at that
early day should suffer.</p>

<p>Thus far John Adams stands alone. If any other
President has made appointments from his own family,
it has been on so petty a scale as not to be recognized
in history. John Quincy Adams, when President, did
not follow his father. An early letter to his mother
foreshadows a rule not unlike that of Jefferson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hope, my ever dear and honored mother, that you are
fully convinced from my letters, which you have before this received,
that upon the contingency of my father’s being placed
in the first magistracy I shall never give him any trouble by
solicitation for office of any kind. Your late letters have repeated
so many times that I shall in that case have nothing
to <i>expect</i>, that I am afraid you have imagined it possible that
I <i>might</i> form expectations from such an event. I had hoped
that <i>my mother</i> knew me better; that she did me the justice
to believe that I have not been so totally regardless or forgetful
of the principles which my education had instilled, nor so
totally destitute of a <i>personal</i> sense of delicacy, as to be susceptible
of a wish tending in that direction.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To Jefferson’s sense of public duty John Quincy Adams
added the sense of personal delicacy, both strong against
such appointment of relations. To the irresistible judgment
against this abuse, a recent moralist, of lofty nature,
Theodore Parker, imparts new expression, when he
says, “It is a dangerous and unjust practice.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> This is
simple and monitory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<h4>PRESIDENTIAL APOLOGIES FOR NEPOTISM.</h4>

<p>Without the avalanche of testimony against this Presidential
pretension, it is necessary only to glance at the
defences sometimes set up; for such is the insensibility
bred by Presidential example, that even this intolerable
outrage is not without voices speaking for the President.
Sometimes it is said, that, his salary being far from royal,
the people will not scan closely an attempt to help relations,&mdash;which,
being interpreted, means that the President
may supplement the pettiness of his salary by the
appointing power. Let John Adams, who did not hesitate
to bestow office upon a few relations of unquestioned
merit, judge this pretension. I quote his words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every public man should be honestly paid for his services.…
But he should be restrained from every <i>perquisite</i>
not known to the laws, and he should make no claims upon
the gratitude of the public, nor ever confer an office within
his patronage upon a son, a brother, a friend, upon pretence
that he is not paid for his services by the profits of his office.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is impossible to deny the soundness of this requirement
and its completeness as an answer to one of the
apologies.</p>

<p>Sometimes the defender is more audacious, insisting
openly upon the Presidential prerogative without question,
until we seem to hear in aggravated form the obnoxious
cry, “To the victor belong the spoils.” I did
not suppose that this old cry could be revived in any
form; but since it is heard again, I choose to expose it;
and here I use the language of Madison, whose mild
wisdom has illumined so much of constitutional duty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
In his judgment the pretension was odious, “that offices
and emoluments were the spoils of victory, <i>the personal
property</i> of the successful candidate for the Presidency”;
and he adds in words not to be forgotten at this
moment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The principle, if avowed without the practice, or practised
without the avowal, could not fail to degrade any Administration,&mdash;both
together, completely so.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is strong language. The rule in its early form
could not fail to degrade any Administration. But now
this degrading rule is extended, and we are told that to
the President’s family belong the spoils.</p>

<p>Another apology, vouchsafed even on this floor, is,
that, if the President cannot appoint his relations, they
alone of all citizens are excluded from office,&mdash;which, it
is said, should not be. But is it not for the public good
that they should be excluded? Such was the wise judgment
of Jefferson, and such is the testimony from another
quarter. That eminent prelate, Bishop Butler,
who has given to English literature one of its most
masterly productions, known as “Butler’s Analogy,”
after his elevation to the see of Durham with its remarkable
patronage, was so self-denying with regard to his
family that a nephew said to him, “Methinks, my Lord,
it is a misfortune to be related to you.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Golden words
of honor for the English Bishop! But none such have
been earned by the American President.</p>

<p>Assuming that in case of positive merit designating a
citizen for a particular post the President might appoint
a relation, it would be only where the merit was so shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
that his absence would be noticed. At least it must
be such as to make the citizen a candidate without regard
to family. But no such merit is attributed to the
beneficiaries of our President, some of whom have done
little but bring scandal upon the public service. At
least one is tainted with fraud; and another, with the
commission of the Republic abroad, has been guilty of
indiscretions inconsistent with his trust. Appointed
originally in open defiance of republican principles, they
have been retained in office after their unfitness became
painfully manifest. By the testimony before a Congressional
Committee, one of these, a brother-in-law, was
implicated in bribery and corruption. It is said that
at last, after considerable delay, the President has consented
to his removal.</p>

<p>Here I leave for the present this enormous unrepublican
pretension, waiting to hear if it can again find an
apologist. Is there a single Senator who will not dismiss
it to judgment?</p>

<h4>GIFT-TAKING,&mdash;AND REPAYMENT WITH OFFICE.</h4>

<p>From one typical abuse I pass to another. From a
dropsical Nepotism swollen to elephantiasis, which nobody
can defend, I pass to Gift-Taking, which with our
President has assumed an unprecedented form. Sometimes
public men even in our country have taken gifts,
but it is not known that any President before has repaid
the patron with office. For a public man to take gifts
is reprehensible; for a President to select Cabinet councillors
and other officers among those from whom he has
taken gifts is an anomaly in republican annals. Observe,
Sir, that I speak of it gently, unwilling to exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the indignation which such a Presidential pretension is
calculated to arouse. The country will judge it, and
blot it out as an example.</p>

<p>There have been throughout history corrupt characters
in official station; but, whether in ancient or modern
times, the testimony is constant against the taking
of gifts, and nowhere with more force than in our Scriptures,
where it is said: “Thou shalt not wrest judgment,
thou shalt not respect persons, <i>neither take a gift</i>; for
a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Here is the
inhibition, and also the reason, which slight observation
shows to be true. Does not a gift blind the eyes of the
wise? The influence of gifts is represented by Plutarch
in the life of a Spartan king:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For he thought those ways of entrapping men by gifts
and presents, which other kings use, dishonest and inartificial;
and it seemed to him to be the most noble method and
most suitable to a king to win the affections of those that came
near him by personal intercourse and agreeable conversation,
since between a friend and a mercenary the only distinction
is, that we gain the one by one’s character and conversation,
the other by one’s money.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

</div>

<p>What is done under the influence of a gift is mercenary;
but whether from ruler to subject or from subject
to ruler, the gift is equally pernicious. An ancient patriot
“feared the Greeks bearing gifts,”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and these words
have become a proverb; but there are Greeks bearing
gifts elsewhere than at Troy. A public man can traffic
with such only at his peril. At their appearance the
prayer should be said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> “Lead us not into temptation.”</p>

<p>The best examples testify. Thus, in the autobiography
of Lord Brougham, posthumously published, it appears
that at a great meeting in Glasgow five hundred pounds
were subscribed as a gift to him for his public service,
to be put into such form as he might think best. He
hesitated. “This required,” he records, “much consideration,
as such gifts were liable to be abused.” Not content
with his own judgment, he assembled some friends
to discuss it,&mdash;“Lord Holland, Lord Erskine, Romilly,
and Baring,”&mdash;and he wrote to Earl Grey, afterward
Prime-Minister, who replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Both Grenville and I accepted from the Catholics of
Glasgow a piece of plate&mdash;of no great value indeed&mdash;<i>after
we were turned out</i> in 1807.… If you still feel scruples, I
can only add that it is impossible to err on the side of delicacy
with respect to matters of this nature.”</p>

</div>

<p>It ended in his declining to accept anything more
than the small top of a gold inkstand.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>In our country Washington keeps his lofty heights,
setting himself against gift-taking as against nepotism.
In 1785, while in private life, two years after he ceased
to be commander-in-chief of our armies and four years
before he became President, he could not be induced to
accept a certain amount of canal stock offered him by
the State of Virginia, as appears in an official communication:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that the Assembly
yesterday, without a dissenting voice, complimented you
with fifty shares in the Potomac Company and one hundred
in the James River Company.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Fully to appreciate the reply of Washington, it must
be borne in mind, that, according to Washington Irving,
his biographer, “some degree of economy was necessary,
for his financial concerns had suffered during the war,
and the products of his estate had fallen off.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> But
he was not tempted. Thus he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How would this matter be viewed by the eye of the
world, and what would be the opinion of it, when it comes
to be related that George Washington has received twenty
thousand dollars and five thousand pounds sterling of the
public money as an interest therein?… Under whatever
pretence, and however customarily these gratuitous gifts are
made in other countries, should I not thenceforward be considered
as a dependant?”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And subsequently to Jefferson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I never for a moment entertained an idea of accepting
it.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

</div>

<p>How admirably he touches the point when he asks,
“Should I not thenceforward be considered as a dependant?”
According to our Scripture the gift blinds the
eyes; according to Washington it makes the receiver a
dependant.</p>

<p>In harmony with this sentiment was his subsequent
refusal, when President, as is recorded by an ingenuous
writer:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He was exceedingly careful about committing himself;
<i>would receive no favors of any kind</i>, and scrupulously paid for
everything.… A large house was set apart for him on
Ninth Street, [Philadelphia,] on the grounds now covered by
the Pennsylvania University, <i>which he refused to accept</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

</div>

<p>By such instances, brought to light recently, and shining
in contrast with our times, we learn to admire anew
the virtue of Washington.</p>

<p>It would be easy to show how in all ages the refusal of
gifts has been recognized as the sign of virtue, if not the
requirement of duty. The story of St. Louis of France
is beautiful and suggestive. Leaving on a crusade, he
charged the Queen, who remained behind, “not to accept
presents for herself or her children.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Such was one of
the injunctions by which this monarch, when far away on
a pious expedition, impressed himself upon his country.</p>

<p>My own strong convictions on this Presidential pretension
were aroused in a conversation which it was my
privilege to enjoy with John Quincy Adams, as he sat
in his sick-chamber at his son’s house in Boston, a short
time before he fell at his post of duty in the House of
Representatives. In a voice trembling with age and
with emotion, he said that no public man could take
gifts without peril; and he confessed that his own judgment
had been quickened by the example of Count Romanzoff,
the eminent Chancellor of the Russian Empire,
who, after receiving costly gifts from foreign sovereigns
with whom he had negotiated treaties, felt a difficulty
of conscience in keeping them, and at last handed over
their value to a hospital, as he related to Mr. Adams,
then Minister at St. Petersburg.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The latter was impressed
by this Russian example, and through his long
career, as Minister abroad, Secretary of State, President,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and Representative, always refused gifts, unless a book
or some small article in its nature a token and not a reward
or bribe.</p>

<p>The Constitution testifies against the taking of gifts
by officers of the United States, when it provides that
“no person holding any office of profit or trust under
them shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept
of any present or emolument from any king, prince, or
foreign State.” The acceptance of a present or emolument
from our own citizens was left without constitutional
inhibition, to be constrained by the public conscience
and the just aversion to any semblance of bargain
and sale, or bribery, in the public service.</p>

<p>The case of our President is exceptional. Notoriously
he has taken gifts while in the public service, some at
least after he had been elected President, until “the
Galena tanner of a few hundred dollars a year”&mdash;to
borrow the words of my colleague [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>], one of
his supporters&mdash;is now rich in houses, lands, and stock,
above his salary, being probably the richest President
since George Washington. Notoriously he has appointed
to his Cabinet several among these “Greeks bearing
gifts,” without seeming to see the indecorum, if not the
indecency, of the transaction. At least two, if not three,
of these Greeks, having no known position in the Republican
Party, or influence in the country, have been
selected as his counsellors in national affairs and heads
of great departments of government. Again do I repeat
the words of our Scriptures, “A gift doth blind the eyes
of the wise”; again the words of Washington, “Should
I not thenceforward be considered as a dependant?”</p>

<p>Nor does the case of the first Secretary of State differ
in character from that of the other three Cabinet officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
referred to. The President, feeling under personal
obligation to Mr. Washburne for important support, gave
him a complimentary nomination, with the understanding
that after confirmation he should forthwith resign.
I cannot forget the indignant comment of the late Mr.
Fessenden, as we passed out of the Senate Chamber immediately
after the confirmation. “Who,” said he, “ever
heard before of a man nominated Secretary of State
merely as a compliment?” But this is only another
case of the public service subordinated to personal
considerations.</p>

<p>Not only in the Cabinet, but in other offices, there is
reason to believe that the President has been under the
influence of patrons. Why was he so blind to Thomas
Murphy? The custom-house of New York, with all its
capacity as a political engine, was handed over to this
agent, whose want of recognition in the Republican
Party was outbalanced by Presidential favor, and whose
gifts have become notorious. And when the demand
for his removal was irresistible, the President accepted
his resignation with an effusion of sentiment natural
toward a patron, but without justification in the character
of the retiring officer.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, who saw intuitively the springs of human
conduct, touches more than once on the operation
of the gift. “I’ll do thee service for so good a gift,”
said Gloster to Warwick.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Then, again, how truly spoke
the lord, who said of Timon,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent8">“No gift to him</div>
<div class="verse">But breeds the giver a return exceeding</div>
<div class="verse">All use of quittance.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And such were the returns made by the President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus much for gifts, reciprocated by office. The instance
is original and without precedent in our history.</p>

<h4>THE PRESIDENCY A PERQUISITE.</h4>

<p>I have now completed the survey of the two typical
instances&mdash;Nepotism, and Gift-Taking with repayment
by office&mdash;in which we are compelled to see the President.
In these things he shows himself. Here is no
portrait drawn by critic or enemy; it is the original
who stands forth, saying: “Behold the generosity I
practise to my relations at the expense of the public
service! also the gifts I take, and then my way of rewarding
the patrons, always at the expense of the public
service!” In this open exhibition we see how the
Presidency, instead of a trust, has become a perquisite.
Bad as are these two capital instances, and important as
is their condemnation, so that they may not become a
precedent, I dwell on them now as illustrating character.
A President who can do such things, and not recognize
at once the error he has committed, shows that supereminence
of egotism under which Constitution, International
Law, and Municipal Law, to say nothing of Republican
Government in its primary principles, are all
subordinated to the Presidential will; and this is Personal
Government. Add an insensibility to the honest
convictions of others, and you have a natural feature of
this pretension.</p>

<p>Lawyers cite what are called “Leading Cases.” A
few of these show the Presidential will in constant
operation with little regard to precedent or reason, so as
to be a caprice, if it were not a pretension. Imitating
the Popes in Nepotism, the President has imitated them
in ostentatious assumption of Infallibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE PRESIDENT’S INAUGURAL ADDRESS.</h4>

<p>Other Presidents have entered upon their high office
with a certain modesty and distrust. Washington in
his Inaugural Address declared his “anxieties,” also his
sense of “the magnitude and difficulty of the trust,”
“awakening a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Jefferson, in his famous Inaugural, so replete
with political wisdom, after declaring his “sincere consciousness
that the task is above his talents,” says: “I
approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments
which the greatness of the charge and the weakness of
my powers so justly inspire, … and humble myself
before the magnitude of the undertaking.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Our soldier, absolutely untried in civil life, entirely a
new man, entering upon the sublimest duties, before
which Washington and Jefferson had shrunk, said in his
Inaugural: “The responsibilities of the position I feel,
but <i>accept them without fear</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Great predecessors, with
ample preparation for the responsibilities, had shrunk
back with fear. He had none. Either he did not see
the responsibilities, or the Cæsar began to stir in his
bosom.</p>

<h4>SELECTION OF HIS CABINET.</h4>

<p>Next after the Inaugural Address, his first official act
was the selection of his Cabinet; and here the general
disappointment was equalled by the general wonder.
As the President was little known except from the victories
which had commended him, it was not then seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
how completely characteristic was this initial act. Looking
back upon it, we recognize the pretension by which
all tradition, usage, and propriety were discarded, by
which the just expectations of the party that had elected
him were set at nought, and the safeguards of constitutional
government were subordinated to the personal
pretensions of One Man. In this Cabinet were persons
having small relations with the Republican Party and
little position in the country, some absolutely without
claims from public service, and some actually disqualified
by the gifts they had made to the President. Such
was the political phenomenon presented for the first
time in American history, while reported sayings of the
President showed the simplicity with which he acted.
To a committee he described his Cabinet as his “family,”
with which no stranger could be allowed to interfere, and
to a member of Congress he announced that he selected
his Cabinet “to please himself and nobody else,”&mdash;being
good rules unquestionably for the organization of
a household and the choice of domestics, to which the
Cabinet seem to have been likened. This personal
government flowered in the Navy Department, where a
gift-bearing Greek was suddenly changed to a Secretary.
No less a personage than the grand old Admiral, the
brave, yet modest Farragut, was reported as asking, on
the fifth of March, the very day when the Cabinet was
announced, in unaffected ignorance, “Do you know anything
of Borie?” And yet this unconspicuous citizen,
bearer of gifts to the President, was constituted the naval
superior of that historic character. If others were
less obscure, the Cabinet as a unit was none the less notable
as the creature of Presidential will, where Chance
vied with Favoritism as arbiter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is so strange, when we consider the true idea
of a Cabinet. Though not named in the Constitution,
yet by virtue of unbroken usage among us, and in harmony
with constitutional governments everywhere, the
Cabinet has become a constitutional body, hardly less
than if expressly established by the Constitution itself.
Its members, besides being the heads of great departments,
are the counsellors of the President, with the
duty to advise him of all matters within the sphere of
his office, being nothing less than the great catalogue in
the Preamble of the Constitution, beginning with duty
to the Union, and ending with the duty to secure the
blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity. Besides
undoubted fitness for these exalted responsibilities,
as head of a department and as counsellor, a member
should have such acknowledged position in the country
that his presence inspires confidence and gives strength
to the Administration. How little these things were
regarded by the President need not be said.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the President has a discretion in the
appointment of his Cabinet; but it is a constitutional
discretion, regulated by regard for the interests of the
country and not by mere personal will, by statesmanship
and not by favoritism. A Cabinet is a national
institution and not a Presidential perquisite,&mdash;unless
our President is allowed to copy the example of Imperial
France. In all constitutional governments, the
Cabinet is selected on public reasons, and with a single
eye to the public service; it is not in any respect the
“family” of the sovereign, nor is it “to please himself
and nobody else.” English monarchs have often accepted
statesmen personally disagreeable, when they had
become representatives of the prevailing party,&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
when George the Third, the most obstinate of rulers, accepted
Fox, and George the Fourth, as prejudiced as his
father was obstinate, accepted Canning, each bringing to
the service commanding faculties. It is related that the
Duke of Wellington, with military frankness, encountered
the personal objections of the King in the latter
case, by saying: “Your Majesty is the sovereign of England,
with duties to your people far above any to yourself;
and these duties render it imperative that you
should at this time employ the abilities of Mr. Canning.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
By such instances in a constitutional government is the
Cabinet fixed as a constitutional and not a personal
body. It is only by some extraordinary hallucination
that the President of a Republic dedicated to Constitutional
Liberty can imagine himself invested with a
transforming prerogative above that of any English sovereign,
by which his counsellors are changed from public
officers to personal attendants, and a great constitutional
body, in which all citizens have a common interest,
is made a perquisite of the President.</p>

<h4>APPROPRIATION OF THE OFFICES.</h4>

<p>Marked among the spectacles which followed, and
kindred in character with the appropriation of the Cabinet
as individual property, was the appropriation of the
offices of the country, to which I refer in this place even
at the expense of repetition. Obscure and undeserving
relations, marriage connections, personal retainers, army
associates, friends of unknown fame and notable only as
personal friends or friends of his relations, evidently
absorbed the Presidential mind during those months of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
obdurate reticence when a generous people supposed the
Cabinet to be the all-absorbing thought. Judging by
the facts, it would seem as if the chief and most spontaneous
thought was how to exploit the appointing power
to his own personal behoof. At this period the New
York Custom-House presented itself to the imagination,
and a letter was written consigning a military dependant
to the generosity of the Collector. You know the
rest. Dr. Johnson, acting as executor in selling the distillery
of Mr. Thrale, said: “We are not here to sell a
parcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing
rich beyond the dreams of avarice.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> If the President
did not use the sounding phrase of the great English
moralist, it is evident that his military dependant
felt in that letter all the “potentiality” advertised in
the earlier case, and acted accordingly.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to say that in these things there
was departure from the requirements of law, whether in
the appointment of his Cabinet or of personal favorites,
even in return for personal benefactions, although it was
plainly unrepublican, offensive, and indefensible. But
this same usurping spirit, born of an untutored egotism,
brooking no restraint, showed itself in another class of
transactions, to which I have already referred, where
Law and Constitution were little regarded.</p>

<h4>PRESIDENTIAL ASSAULT ON A SAFEGUARD OF THE
TREASURY.</h4>

<p>First in time and very indigenous in character was
the Presidential attempt against one of the sacred safeguards
of the Treasury, the original workmanship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Alexander Hamilton, being nothing less than the “Act
to establish the Treasury Department.” Here was an
important provision, “that no person appointed to any
office instituted by this Act shall directly or indirectly
be concerned or interested in carrying on the business
of trade or commerce”; and any person so offending was
declared guilty of a high misdemeanor, and was to forfeit
to the United States three thousand dollars, with
removal from office, and forever thereafter to be incapable
of holding any office under the United States.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
From the beginning this statute had stood unquestioned,
until it had acquired the character of fundamental law.
And yet the President, by a special message, dated
March 6, 1869, being the second day of his first service
as a civilian, asked Congress to set it aside, so as to enable
Mr. Stewart, of New York already nominated and
confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury, to enter upon
the duties of this office.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> This gentleman was unquestionably
the largest merchant who had transacted business
in our country, and his imports were of such magnitude
as to clog the custom-house. If the statute was
anything but one of those cobwebs which catch the
weak, but yield to the rich, this was the occasion for it,
and the President should have yielded to no temptation
against it. The indecorum of his effort stands out more
painfully when it is considered that the merchant for
whom he wished to set aside a time-honored safeguard
was one of those from whom he had received gifts.</p>

<p>Such was the accommodating disposition of the Senate,
that a bill exempting the Presidential benefactor from
the operation of the statute was promptly introduced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and even read twice, until, as it seemed about to pass,
I felt it my duty to object to its consideration, saying,
according to the Globe, “I think it ought to be most
profoundly considered before it is acted on by the Senate.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
This objection caused its postponement. The
country was startled. By telegraph the general anxiety
was communicated to Washington. Three days later
the President sent a message requesting permission to
withdraw the former message.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> But he could not withdraw
the impression produced by such open disregard
of the law to promote his personal desire.</p>

<h4>ILLEGAL MILITARY RING AT THE EXECUTIVE
MANSION.</h4>

<p>The military spirit, which failed in the effort to set
aside a fundamental law as if it were a transient order,
was more successful at the Executive Mansion, which at
once assumed the character of military head-quarters.
To the dishonor of the civil service, and in total disregard
of precedent, the President surrounded himself with
officers of the Army, and substituted military forms for
those of civil life, detailing for this service members of
his late staff. The earliest public notice of this military
occupation appeared in the “Daily Morning Chronicle”
of March 8, 1869, understood to be the official organ of
the Administration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“President Grant was not at the White House yesterday,
but the following members of his staff were occupying the
Secretaries’ rooms and acting as such: Generals Babcock,
Porter, Badeau, and Dent.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>This is to be regarded not only in its strange blazonry
of the Presidential pretension, but also as the first apparition
of that minor <i>military ring</i> in which the President
has lived ever since.</p>

<p>Thus installed, Army officers became secretaries of
the President, delivering his messages to both Houses
of Congress, and even authenticating Presidential acts
as if they were military orders. Here, for instance, is
an official communication:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Executive Mansion</span>,<br />
Washington, D. C., March 15, 1869.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Robert Martin Douglas</span>, Esq.:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;You are hereby appointed Assistant Private Secretary
to the President, to date from the 15th March, 1869.</p>

<p class="sig">By order of the President,</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Horace Porter</span>,<br />
<i>Brevet Brigadier-General, Secretary</i>.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mark the words, “By order of the President,” and
then the signature, “Horace Porter, Brevet Brigadier-General,
Secretary.”</p>

<p>The Presidential pretension which I exhibit on the
simple facts, besides being of doubtful legality, to say
the least, was of evil example, demoralizing alike to the
military and civil service, and an undoubted reproach
to republican institutions in that primary principle, announced
by Jefferson in his first Inaugural Address, “the
supremacy of the civil over the military authority.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
It seemed only to remain that the President should sign
his Messages, “Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the
United States.” Evidently a new order of things had
arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Observe the mildness of my language, when I call
this Presidential pretension “of doubtful legality.” The
law shall speak for itself. Obviously it was the same
for our military President as for his predecessors, and
it was recent also:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The President is hereby authorized to appoint a private
secretary at an annual salary of $3,500, an assistant secretary
at an annual salary of $2,500, a short-hand writer at an annual
salary of $2,500, a clerk of pardons at an annual salary
of $2,000, and three clerks of the fourth class.”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It cannot be doubted that this provision was more
than ample; for Congress, by Act of July 20, 1868, repealed
so much as authorized a clerk of pardons, and also
one of the three clerks of the fourth class.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Therefore
there could be no necessity for a levy of soldiers to
perform the duties of secretaries, and the conduct of the
President can be explained only by the supposition that
he preferred to be surrounded by Army officers rather
than by civilians, continuing in the Executive Mansion
the traditions of head-quarters: all which, though agreeable
to him and illustrating his character, was an anomaly
and a scandal.</p>

<p>In extenuation of this indefensible pretension, we
have been reminded of two things: first, that according
to the record Washington sent his first message by General
Knox,&mdash;when in fact General Knox held no military
office at that time, but was actually Secretary of
War; and, secondly, that the military officers now occupying
the Executive Mansion are detailed for this service
without other salary than that of their grade. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the Knox precedent is moonshine, the minor military
ring can be vindicated only as a “detail” for service in
the Executive Mansion.</p>

<p>Here again the law shall speak. By Act of Congress
of March 3, 1863, it is provided that “details to special
service shall only be made with the consent of the commanding
officer of forces in the field”;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> but this, it will
be seen, refers to a state of war. Congress, by Act of
July 16, 1866, authorized the President to “detail from
the Army all the officers and agents of this Bureau” [for
the Relief of Freedmen and Refugees];<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> also, by Act of
July 28, 1866, to “detail” officers of the Army, not exceeding
twenty at any time, “to act as president, superintendent,
or professor” in certain colleges.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> And then
again, by Act of July 15, 1870, it provided that “any
retired officer may, on his own application, be detailed
to serve as professor in any college.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> As there is no
other statute authorizing details, this exceptional transfer
of Army officers to the Executive Mansion can be
maintained only on some undefined prerogative.</p>

<p>The Presidential pretension, which is continued to
the present time, is the more unnatural when it is considered
that there are at least three different statutes in
which Congress has shown its purpose to limit the employment
of military officers in civil service. As long
ago as July 5, 1838, it was positively provided that no
Army officers should be separated from their regiments
and corps “for employment on civil works of internal
improvement, or be allowed to engage in the service of
incorporated companies”; nor any line officer to be acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
paymaster or disbursing agent for the Indian Department,
“if such extra employment require that he be
separated from his regiment or company, or otherwise
interfere with the performance of the military duties
proper.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Obviously the will of Congress is here declared,
that officers should not be allowed to leave their
posts for any service which might <i>interfere with the performance
of the military duties proper</i>. This language is
explicit. Then came the Act of March 30, 1868, which
provides that “any officer of the Army or Navy of the
United States, who shall, after the passage of this Act,
accept or hold any appointment in the diplomatic or
consular service of the Government, shall be considered
as having resigned his said office, and the place held by
him in the military or naval service shall be deemed
and taken to be vacant.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> To a considerate and circumspect
President, who recognized the law in its spirit as
well as its letter, this provision, especially when reinforced
by the earlier statute, would have been a rule of
action in analogous cases, and therefore an insurmountable
obstacle to a pretension which takes Army officers
from their proper duties and makes them Presidential
secretaries. A later statute adds to the obstacle. By
Act of Congress of July 15, 1870, it is provided:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it shall not be lawful for any officer of the Army of
the United States on the active list <i>to hold any civil office,
whether by election or appointment</i>; and any such officer <i>accepting
or exercising the functions of a civil office</i> shall at once
cease to be an officer of the Army, and his commission shall
be vacated thereby.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine anything plainer than these
words. No Army officer not on the retired list can hold
any civil office; and then, to enforce the inhibition, it is
provided that in “accepting or exercising the functions”
of such office the commission is vacated. Now the Blue
Book, which is our political almanac, has under the
head of “Executive Mansion” a list of “secretaries” and
“clerks,” beginning as follows: “Secretaries, General F.
T. Dent, General Horace Porter, General O. E. Babcock,”
when, in fact, there are no such officers authorized by
law. Then follow the “Private Secretary,” “Assistant
Private Secretary,” and “Executive Clerks,” authorized
by law, but placed below those unauthorized. Nothing
is said of being detailed for this purpose. They are
openly called “Secretaries,” which is a title of office;
and since it is at the Executive Mansion, it must be a
civil office; and yet, in defiance of law, these Army officers
continue to exercise its functions, and some of them
enter the Senate with messages from the President. The
apology that they are “detailed” for this service is vain;
no authority can be shown for it. But how absurd to
suppose that a rule against the exercise of a civil office
can be evaded by a “detail”! If it may be done for
three Army officers, why not for three dozen? Nay,
more, if the civil office of Secretary at the Executive
Mansion may be created without law, why not some
other civil office? And what is to hinder the President
from surrounding himself not only with secretaries,
but with messengers, stewards, and personal attendants,
even a body-guard, all detailed from the Army?
Why may he not enlarge the military circle at the Executive
Mansion indefinitely? If the President can
be justified in his present course, there is no limit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
his pretensions in open violation of the statute. Here
the Blue Book testifies again; for it records the names
of the “secretaries” in their proper places as Army officers,&mdash;thus
presenting them as holding two incompatible
offices.</p>

<p>I dismiss this transaction as another instance of Presidential
pretension, which, in the interest of Republican
Government, should be arrested.</p>

<h4>UNREPUBLICAN SUBORDINATION OF THE WAR DEPARTMENT
TO THE GENERAL-IN-CHIEF.</h4>

<p>From the Executive Mansion pass now to the War
Department, and there we witness the same Presidential
pretensions by which law, usage, and correct principle
are lost in the will of One Man. The supremacy
of the civil power over the military is typified in the
Secretary of War, a civilian, from whom Army officers
receive orders. But this beautiful rule, with its lesson
to the military of subordination, was suddenly set aside
by our President, and the Secretary of War degraded to
be a clerk. The 5th of March witnessed a most important
order from the President, placing the Military Departments
under officers of his choice,&mdash;purporting to
be signed by the Assistant Adjutant-General by command
of the General of the Army, but actually ignoring
the Secretary of War.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Three days later, March 8th,
witnessed another order professing to proceed from the
President, whereby in express terms the War Department
was subordinated to the General-in-Chief, being
William T. Sherman, who at the time was promoted to
that command. Here are the words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The chiefs of staff corps, departments, and bureaus will
report to and act under the immediate orders of the General
commanding the Army.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This act of revolution, exalting the military power
above the civil, showed instant fruits in an order of the
General, who, upon assuming command, proceeded to
place the several bureau officers of the War Department
upon his military staff,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> so that for the time there was a
military dictatorship with the President at its head, not
merely in spirit but in actual form. By-and-by John A.
Rawlins, a civilian by education and a respecter of the
Constitution, became Secretary of War, and, though
bound to the President by personal ties, he said, “Check
to the King.” By General Order, issued from the War
Department March 26, 1869, and signed by the Secretary
of War, the offensive order was rescinded, and it
was enjoined that “all official business which by law or
regulations requires the action of the President or Secretary
of War will be submitted by the chiefs of staff
corps, departments, and bureaus to the Secretary of
War.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Public report said that this restoration of the
civil power to its rightful supremacy was not obtained
without an intimation of resignation on the part of the
Secretary.</p>

<h4>THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY BY DEPUTY.</h4>

<p>Kindred in character was the unprecedented attempt
to devolve the duties of the Navy Department upon a
deputy, so that orders were to be signed “A. E. Borie,
Secretary of the Navy, per D. D. Porter, Admiral,” as
appears in the official journal of May 11, 1869,&mdash;or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
according to another instance, “David D. Porter, Vice-Admiral,
for the Secretary of the Navy.” The obvious
object of this illegal arrangement was to enable the incumbent,
who stood high on the list of gift-makers, to
be Secretary without being troubled with the business of
the office. Notoriously he was an invalid, unused to public
business, who, according to his own confession, modestly
pleaded that he could not apply himself to work
more than an hour a day; but the President soothed his
anxieties by promising a deputy who would do the work.
And thus was this great department made a plaything;
but public opinion and other counsels arrested the sport.
Here I mention, that, when this incumbent left his important
post, it is understood that he was allowed to
nominate his successor.</p>

<h4>PRESIDENTIAL PRETENSION AT THE INDIAN BUREAU.</h4>

<p>At the same time occurred the effort to absorb the
Indian Bureau into the War Department, changing its
character as part of the civil service. Congress had already
repudiated such an attempt;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> but the President,
not disheartened by legislative failure, sought to accomplish
it by manipulation and indirection. First elevating
a member of his late staff to the head of the Bureau,
he then, by a military order dated May 7, 1869,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> proceeded
to detail for the Indian service a long list of
“officers left out of their regimental organizations by
the consolidation of the infantry regiments,”&mdash;assuming
to do this by authority of the Act of Congress of
June 30, 1834, which, after declaring the number of Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
agents, and how they shall be appointed, provides
that “it shall be competent for the President to require
any military officer of the United States to execute the
duties of Indian agent.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Obviously this provision had
reference to some exceptional exigency, and can be no
authority for the general substitution of military officers,
instead of civilians confirmed by the Senate and bound
with sureties for the faithful discharge of their duties.
And yet upward of sixty Army officers were in this way
foisted into the Indian service. The Act of Congress of
July 15, 1870, already quoted,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> creating an incompatibility
between military and civil service, was aimed
partly at this abuse, and these officers ceased to be Indian
agents. But this attempt is another illustration
of Presidential pretension.</p>

<h4>MILITARY INTERFERENCE AT ELECTIONS.</h4>

<p>Then followed military interference in elections, and
the repeated use of the military in aid of the revenue
law under circumstances of doubtful legality, until at
last General Halleck and General Sherman protested:
the former in his report of October 24, 1870, saying, “I
respectfully repeat the recommendation of my last Annual
Report, that military officers should not interfere in
local civil difficulties, unless called out in the manner
provided by law;”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and the latter, in his Report of November
10, 1870,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> “I think the soldiers ought not to be
expected to make individual arrests, or to do any act of
violence, except in their organized capacity as a <i>posse
comitatus</i> duly summoned by the United States marshal,
and acting in his personal presence.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> And so this military
pretension, invading civil affairs, was arrested.</p>

<h4>PRESIDENTIAL PRETENSION AGAIN.</h4>

<p>Meanwhile this same Presidential usurpation, subordinating
all to himself, became palpable in another form.
It was said of Gustavus Adolphus, that he drilled his
Diet to vote at the word of command. Such at the outset
seemed to be the Presidential policy with regard to
Congress. We were to vote as he desired. He did not
like the Tenure-of-Office Act, and during the first month
of his administration his influence was felt in both
branches of Congress to secure its repeal; all of which
seemed more astonishing when it was considered that
he entered upon his high trust with the ostentatious
avowal that all laws would be faithfully executed, whether
they met his approval or not, and that he should
have no policy to enforce against the will of the people.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
That beneficent statute, which he had upheld in the
impeachment of President Johnson, was a limitation on
the Presidential power of appointment, and he could not
brook it. Here was plain interference with his great
perquisite of office, and Congress must be coerced to
repeal it. The House acted promptly and passed the
desired bill. In the Senate there was delay and a
protracted debate, during which the official journal
announced:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> “The President, in conversation with a
prominent Senator a few days since, declared that it
was his intention not to send in any nominations of
importance until definite action was taken by Congress
upon the Tenure-of-Office Bill.”<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Here I venture to add, that a member of the Cabinet
pressed me to withdraw my opposition to the repeal,
saying that the President felt strongly upon it. I could
not understand how a Republican President could consent
to weaken the limitations upon the Executive, and
so I said,&mdash;adding, that in my judgment he should
rather reach forth his hands and ask to have them tied.
Better always a government of law than of men.</p>

<h4>PRESIDENTIAL INTERFERENCE IN LOCAL POLITICS.</h4>

<p>In this tyrannical spirit, and in the assumption of
his central imperialism, he has interfered with political
questions and party movements in distant States,
reaching into Missouri, and then into New York, to dictate
how the people should vote, then manipulating
Louisiana through a brother-in-law appointed Collector.
With him a custom-house seems less a place for the collection
of revenue than an engine of political influence,
through which his dictatorship may be maintained.</p>

<p>Authentic testimony places this tyrannical abuse beyond
question. New York is the scene, and Thomas
Murphy, Collector, the Presidential lieutenant. Nobody
doubts the intimacy between the President and the Collector,
who are bound in friendship by other ties than
those of seaside neighborhood. The Collector was determined
to obtain the control of the Republican State
Convention, and appealed to a patriot citizen for help,
who replied, that in his judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> “it would be a delicate
matter for office-holders to undertake to dictate to
the associations in the different districts who should go
from them to the State Convention, and still more delicate
to attempt to control the judgments of men employed
in the different departments as to the best men
to represent them.” The brave Collector lieutenant of
the President said, “that he should not hesitate to do
it; that it was General Grant’s wish, and General Grant
was the head of the Republican Party, and should be
authority on this subject.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Plainly, the Republican
Party was his perquisite, and all Republicans were to do
his bidding. From other testimony it appears that the
President, according to the statement of his lieutenant,
“wanted to be represented in the Convention,” being the
Republican State Convention of New York,&mdash;“wanted
to have his friends there in the Convention”; and the
Presidential lieutenant, being none other than the famous
Collector, offered to appoint four men in the custom-house
for the witness, if he would secure the nomination
of certain persons as delegates from his district,
and he promised “that he would immediately send their
names on to Washington and have them appointed.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
And so the Presidential dictatorship was administered.
Offices in the custom-house were openly bartered for
votes in the State Convention. Here was intolerable
tyranny, with demoralization like that of the slave-market.</p>

<p>But New York is not the only scene of this outrage.
The Presidential pretension extends everywhere; nor is
it easy to measure the arrogance of corruption or the
honest indignation it quickens into life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<h4>PRESIDENTIAL CONTRIVANCE AGAINST SAN DOMINGO.</h4>

<p>These Presidential pretensions, in all their variety,
personal and military, with reckless indifference to law,
naturally ripened in the contrivance, nursed in hot-house
secrecy, against the peace of the island of San Domingo:
I say deliberately, against the peace of that island, for
under the guise of annexing a portion there was menace
to the Black Republic of Hayti. This whole business,
absolutely indefensible from beginning to end, being
wrong at every point, is the special and most characteristic
product of the Administration, into which it infused
and projected itself more than into anything else.
In this multiform disobedience we behold our President.
Already I have referred to this contrivance as marking an
epoch in Presidential pretensions. It is my duty now to
show its true character as a warning against its author.</p>

<p>A few weeks only after beginning his career as a civilian,
and while occupied with military usurpations and
the perquisites of office, he was tempted by overtures of
Dominican plotters, headed by the usurper Baez and the
speculator Cazneau: the first an adventurer, conspirator,
and trickster, described by one who knows him well
as “the worst man living of whom he has any personal
knowledge”;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and the second, one of our own countrymen,
long resident on the island, known as disloyal
throughout the war, and entirely kindred in character
to Baez. Listening to these prompters, and without one
word in Congress or in the press suggesting annexion of
the island or any part of it, the President began his contrivance;
and here we see abuse in every form and at
every step, absolutely without precedent in our history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The agent in this transaction was Orville E. Babcock,
a young officer figuring in the Blue Book of the time as
one of the unauthorized “secretaries” at the Executive
Mansion, and also as a major of engineers. His published
instructions, under date of July 13, 1869, were
simply to make inquiries; but the plot appears in a
communication of the same date from the Secretary of
the Navy, directed to the Seminole, a war-ship, with an
armament of one eleven-inch gun and four thirty-two
pounders, “to give him the <i>moral support</i> of its guns”;
and this was followed by a telegraphic instruction to
Key West for another war-ship “to proceed without a
moment’s delay to San Domingo City, to be placed at
the disposal of General Babcock while on that coast.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
With such “moral support” the emissary of the President
obtained from the usurper Baez that famous Protocol
stipulating the annexion of Dominica to the United
States in consideration of $1,500,000, which the young
officer, fresh from the Executive Mansion, professed to
execute as “Aide-de-Camp to his Excellency General
Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States,”&mdash;as
if, instead of Chief Magistrate of a Republic, the President
were a military chieftain with his foot in the stirrup,
surrounded by a military staff. The same instrument
contained the unblushing stipulation, that “his
Excellency General Grant, President of the United
States, promises, <i>privately, to use all his influence</i>, in
order that the idea of annexing the Dominican Republic
to the United States may acquire such a degree of popularity
among members of Congress as will be necessary
for its accomplishment”:<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> which is simply that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
President shall become a lobbyist to bring about the annexion
by Congress. Such was the strange beginning,
illegal, unconstitutional, and offensive in every particular,
but showing the Presidential character.</p>

<p>On his return to Washington, the young officer, who
had assumed to be “Aide-de-Camp to his Excellency
General Ulysses S. Grant,” and had bound the President
to become a lobbyist for a wretched scheme, instead of
being disowned and reprimanded, was sent back to the
usurper with instructions to negotiate two treaties,&mdash;one
for the annexion of the half-island of Dominica, and
the other for the lease of the Bay of Samana.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> By the
Constitution of the United States “ambassadors and
other public ministers” are appointed by the President
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; but
our Aide-de-Camp had no such commission. Presidential
prerogative empowered him. Nor was naval force
wanting. With three war-ships at his disposal,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> he concluded
negotiations with Baez and obtained the two treaties.
Naturally force was needed to keep the usurper
in power while he sold his country, and naturally such
a transaction required a Presidential Aide-de-Camp unknown
to Constitution or Law, rather than a civilian
duly appointed according to both.</p>

<h4>PRESIDENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND
INTERNATIONAL LAW.</h4>

<p>On other occasions it has been my solemn duty to
expose the outrages which attended this hateful business,
where at each step we are brought face to face with
Presidential pretension: first, in the open seizure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
war powers of the Government, as if he were already
Cæsar, forcibly intervening in Dominica and menacing
war to Hayti, all of which is proved by the official reports
of the State Department and Navy Department,
being nothing less than war by kingly prerogative, in defiance
of that distinctive principle of Republican Government,
first embodied in our Constitution, which places
the war powers under the safeguard of the legislative
branch, making any attempt by the President “to declare
war” an undoubted usurpation. But our President, like
Gallio, cares for none of these things. The open violation
of the Constitution was naturally followed by a
barefaced disregard of that equality of nations which is
the first principle of International Law, as the equality
of men is the first principle of the Declaration of
Independence; and this sacred rule was set aside in order
to insult and menace Hayti, doing unto the Black
Republic what we would not have that Republic do
unto us, nor what we would have done to any white
power. To these eminent and most painful Presidential
pretensions, the first adverse to the Constitution and the
second adverse to International Law, add the imprisonment
of an American citizen in Dominica by the Presidential
confederate, Baez, for fear of his hostility to the
treaty, if he were allowed to reach New York,&mdash;all of
which was known to his subordinates, Babcock and Cazneau,
and doubtless to himself. What was the liberty
of an American citizen compared with the Presidential
prerogative? To one who had defied the Constitution,
on which depends the liberty of all, and then defied International
Law, on which depends the peace of the
world, a single citizen immured in a distant dungeon
was of small moment. But this is only an illustration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Add now the lawless occupation of the Bay of Samana for
many months after the lapse of the treaty, keeping the
national flag flying there, and assuming a territorial sovereignty
which did not exist. Then add the protracted
support of Baez in his usurped power, to the extent of
placing the national flag at his disposal, and girdling the
island with our ships of war, all at immense cost, and to
the neglect of other service where the Navy was needed.</p>

<p>This strange succession of acts, which, if established
for a precedent, would overturn Constitution and Law,
was followed by another class of Presidential manifestations:
first, an unseemly importunity of Senators during
the pendency of the treaty, visiting the Capitol as a lobbyist,
and summoning them to his presence in squads,
in obvious pursuance of the stipulation made by his
Aide-de-Camp and never disowned by him,&mdash;being intervention
in the Senate, reinforced by all the influence
of the appointing power, whether by reward or menace,
all of which was as unconstitutional in character as that
warlike intervention on the island; and then, after debate
in the Senate, when the treaty was lost on solemn
vote, we were called to witness his self-willed effrontery
in prosecuting the fatal error, returning to the charge in
his Annual Message at the ensuing session, insisting
upon his contrivance as nothing less than the means by
which “our large debt abroad is ultimately to be extinguished,”
and gravely charging the Senate with “folly”
in rejecting the treaty,&mdash;and yet, while making this astounding
charge against a coördinate branch of Government,
and claiming such astounding profits, he blundered
geographically in describing the prize.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>All this diversified performance, with its various eccentricity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of effort, failed. The report of able commissioners
transported to the island in an expensive war-ship
ended in nothing. The American people rose
against the undertaking and insisted upon its abandonment.
By a message charged with Parthian shafts the
President at length announced that he would proceed
no further in this business.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> His senatorial partisans,
being a majority of the Chamber, after denouncing those
who had exposed the business, arrested the discussion.
In obedience to irrepressible sentiments, and according
to the logic of my life, I felt it my duty to speak; but
the President would not forgive me, and his peculiar
representatives found me disloyal to the party which
I had served so long and helped to found. Then was
devotion to the President made the shibboleth of party.</p>

<h4>WHERE WAS THE GRAND INQUEST OF THE NATION?</h4>

<p>Such is a summary of the San Domingo business in
its characteristic features. But here are transgressions
in every form,&mdash;open violation of the Constitution in
more than one essential requirement; open violation of
International Law in more than one of its most beautiful
principles; flagrant insult to the Black Republic,
with menace of war; complicity with the wrongful imprisonment
of an American citizen; lawless assumption
of territorial sovereignty in a foreign jurisdiction; employment
of the national navy to sustain a usurper,&mdash;being
all acts of substance, maintained by an agent calling
himself “Aide-de-Camp to Ulysses S. Grant, President
of the United States,” and stipulating that his chief
should play the lobbyist to help the contrivance through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Congress, then urged by private appeals to Senators, and
the influence of the appointing power tyrannically employed
by the Presidential lobbyist, and finally urged
anew in an Annual Message, where undisguised insult
to the Senate vies with absurdity in declaring prospective
profits and with geographical ignorance. Such, in
brief, is this multiform disobedience, where every particular
is of such aggravation as to merit the most solemn
judgment. Why the grand inquest of the nation,
which brought Andrew Johnson to the bar of the Senate,
should have slept on this conglomerate misdemeanor,
every part of which was offensive beyond any technical
offence charged against his predecessor, while it had
a background of nepotism, gift-taking with official compensation,
and various Presidential pretensions beyond
all precedent,&mdash;all this will be one of the riddles of
American history, to be explained only by the extent
to which the One-Man Power had succeeded in subjugating
the Government.</p>

<h4>INDIGNITY TO THE AFRICAN RACE.</h4>

<p>Let me confess, Sir, that, while at each stage I have
felt this tyranny most keenly, and never doubted that it
ought to be arrested by impeachment, my feelings have
been most stirred by the outrage to Hayti, which, besides
being a wrong to the Black Republic, was an insult
to the colored race, not only abroad, but here at
home. How a Chief Magistrate with four millions of
colored fellow-citizens could have done this thing passes
comprehension. Did he suppose it would not be known?
Did he imagine it could be hushed in official pigeonholes?
Or was he insensible to the true character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
his own conduct? The facts are indisputable. For
more than two generations Hayti had been independent,
entitled under International Law to equality among nations,
and since Emancipation in our country commended
to us as an example of self-government, being the first
in the history of the African race and the promise of the
future. And yet our President, in his effort to secure
that Naboth’s Vineyard on which he had set his eyes,
not content with maintaining the usurper Baez in power,
occupying the harbors of Dominica with war-ships, sent
other war-ships, being none other than our most powerful
monitor, the Dictator, with the frigate Severn as consort,
and with yet other monitors in their train, to strike at
the independence of the Black Republic, and to menace
it with war. Do I err in any way, am I not entirely
right, when I say that here was unpardonable outrage to
the African race? As one who for years has stood by
the side of this much-oppressed people, sympathizing
always in their woes and struggling for them, I felt
the blow which the President dealt, and it became the
more intolerable from the heartless attempts to defend
it. Alas, that our President should be willing to wield
the giant strength of the Great Republic in trampling
upon the representative government of the African race!
Alas, that he did not see the infinite debt of friendship,
kindness, and protection due to that people, so that instead
of monitors and war-ships, breathing violence, he
had sent a messenger of peace and good-will!</p>

<p>This outrage was followed by an incident in which
the same sentiments were revealed. Frederick Douglass,
remarkable for his intelligence as for his eloquence,
and always agreeable in personal relations, whose only
offence is a skin not entirely Caucasian, was selected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the President to accompany the Commissioners to San
Domingo,&mdash;and yet on his return, and almost within sight
of the Executive Mansion, he was repelled from the common
table of the mail-steamer on the Potomac, where
his companions were already seated; and thus through
him was the African race insulted and their equal rights
denied. But the President, whose commission he had
borne, neither did nor said anything to right this wrong,
and a few days later, when entertaining the Commissioners
at the Executive Mansion, actually forgot the
colored orator whose services he had sought.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> But this
indignity is in unison with the rest. After insulting
the Black Republic, it is easy to see how natural it was
to treat with insensibility the representative of the
African race.</p>

<h4>ALL THESE THINGS IN ISSUE NOW.</h4>

<p>Here I stay this painful catalogue in its various
heads, beginning with nepotism and gift-taking with repayment
by office, and ending in the contrivance against
San Domingo with indignity to the African race,&mdash;not
because it is complete, but because it is enough. With
sorrow unspeakable have I made this exposure of pretensions,
which, for the sake of republican institutions,
every good citizen should wish expunged from history;
but I had no alternative. The President himself insists
upon putting them in issue; he will not allow them to
be forgotten. As a candidate for reëlection he invites
judgment, while partisans acting in his behalf make it
absolutely necessary by the brutality of their assault on
faithful Republicans unwilling to see their party, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the Presidential office, a personal perquisite. If his partisans
are exacting, vindictive, and unjust, they act only
in harmony with his nature, too truly represented in
them. There is not a ring, whether military or senatorial,
that does not derive its distinctive character from
himself. Therefore, what they do and what they say
must be considered as done and said by the chieftain
they serve. And here is a new manifestation of that
sovereign egotism which no taciturnity can cover up,
and a new motive for inquiry into its pernicious influence.</p>

<h4>THE GREAT PRESIDENTIAL QUARRELLER.</h4>

<p>Any presentment of the President would be imperfect
which did not show how this ungovernable personality
breaks forth in quarrel, making him the great Presidential
quarreller of our history. As in nepotism,
gift-taking with repayment by office, and Presidential
pretensions generally, here again he is foremost, having
quarrelled not only more than any other President, but
more than all others together, from George Washington
to himself. His own Cabinet, the Senate, the House of
Representatives, the diplomatic service, and the civil
service generally, all have their victims, nearly every
one of whom, besides serving the Republican Party, had
helped to make him President. Nor have Army officers,
his companions in the field, or even his generous
patrons, been exempt. To him a quarrel is not only a
constant necessity, but a perquisite of office. To nurse
a quarrel, like tending a horse, is in his list of Presidential
duties. How idle must he be, should the words of
Shakespeare be fulfilled, “This day all quarrels die”!<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
To him may be applied those other words of Shakespeare,
“As quarrellous as the weasel.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Evidently our President has never read the Eleventh
Commandment: “A President of the United States shall
never quarrel.” At least he lives in perpetual violation
of it, listening to stories from horse-cars, gobbling the
gossip of his military ring, discoursing on imaginary
griefs, and nursing an unjust anger. The elect of forty
millions of people has no right to quarrel with anybody.
His position is too exalted. He cannot do it without
offence to the requirements of patriotism, without a
shock to the decencies of life, without a jar to the harmony
of the universe. If lesson were needed for his
conduct, he might find it in that king of France who on
ascending the throne made haste to declare that he did
not remember injuries received as Dauphin.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Perhaps a
better model still would be Tancred, the acknowledged
type of the perfect Christian knight, who “disdained to
speak ill of whoever it might be, even when ill had been
spoken of himself.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Our soldier President could not
err in following this knightly example. If this were too
much, then at least might we hope that he would consent
to limit the sphere of his quarrelsome operations so
that the public service might not be disturbed. Of this
be assured,&mdash;in every quarrel he is the offender, according
to the fact, as according to every reasonable presumption;
especially is he responsible for its continuance.
The President can always choose his relations with any
citizen. But he chooses discord. With the arrogance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of arms he resents any impediment in his path,&mdash;as
when, in the spring of 1870, without allusion to himself,
I felt it my duty to oppose his San Domingo contrivance.
The verse of Juvenal, as translated by Dryden,
describes his conduct:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Poor me he fights,&mdash;if that be fighting where</div>
<div class="verse">He only cudgels and I only bear.</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">Answer or answer not, ’tis all the same,</div>
<div class="verse">He lays me on and makes me bear the blame.”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Another scholarly translator gives to this description of
the Presidential quarrel another form, which is also applicable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If that be deemed a quarrel, where, Heaven knows,</div>
<div class="verse">He only gives and I receive the blows;</div>
<div class="verse">Across my path he strides and bids me Stand!&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">I bow obsequious to the dread command.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If the latter verse is not entirely true in my case, something
must be pardoned to that Liberty in which I was
born.</p>

<p>Men take their places in history according to their
deeds. The flattery of life is then superseded by the
truthful record, and rulers do not escape judgment.
Louis the Tenth of France has the designation of <i>Le
Hutin</i>, or “The Quarreller,” by which he is known in
the long line of French kings. And so in the long line
of American Chief-Magistrates has our President vindicated
for himself the same title. He must wear it. The
French monarch was younger than our President; but
there are other points in his life which are not without
parallel. According to a contemporary chronicle, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
was “well disposed, but not very attentive to the needs
of the kingdom”;<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and then again it was his rare fortune
to sign one of the greatest ordinances of French
history, declaring that “according to the Law of Nature
every one must be born free”;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> but the Quarreller was
in no respect author of this illustrious act, and was
moved to its adoption by considerations of personal advantage.
It will be for impartial History to determine
if our Quarreller, who treated his great office as a personal
perquisite, and all his life long was against that
Enfranchisement to which he put his name, does not fall
into the same category.</p>

<h4>DUTY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.</h4>

<p>And now the question of Duty is distinctly presented
to the Republican Party. I like that word. It is at
the mandate of Duty that we must act. Do the Presidential
pretensions merit the sanction of the party?
Can Republicans, without departing from all obligations,
whether of party or patriotism, recognize our ambitious
Cæsar as a proper representative? Can we take
the fearful responsibility of his prolonged empire? I
put these questions solemnly, as a member of the Republican
Party, with all the earnestness of a life devoted to
the triumph of this party, but which I served always
with the conviction that I gave up nothing that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
meant for country or mankind. With me, the party
was country and mankind; but with the adoption of all
these Presidential pretensions the party loses its distinctive
character and drops from its sphere. Its creed
ceases to be Republicanism and becomes Grantism; its
members cease to be Republicans and become Grant-men.
It is no longer a <i>political</i> party, but a <i>personal</i>
party. For myself, I say openly, I am no man’s <i>man</i>,
nor do I belong to any personal party.</p>

<h4>ONE TERM FOR PRESIDENT.</h4>

<p>The attempt to change the character of the Republican
Party begins by assault on the principle of One
Term for President. Therefore must our support of this
requirement be made manifest; and here we have the
testimony of our President, and what is stronger, his example,
showing the necessity of such limitation. Authentic
report attests that before his nomination he declared
that “the liberties of the country cannot be maintained
without a One-Term Amendment of the Constitution.”
At this time Mr. Wade was pressing this very
Amendment. Then after his nomination, and while his
election was pending, the organ of the Republican Party
at Washington, where he resided, commended him constantly
as faithful to the principle. The “Morning
Chronicle” of June 3, 1868, after the canvass had commenced,
proclaimed of the candidate,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>He is, moreover, an advocate of the One-Term principle</i>,
as conducing toward the proper administration of the law,&mdash;a
principle with which so many prominent Republicans have
identified themselves that it may be accepted as an article of
party faith.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Then again, July 14th, the same organ insisted,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let not Congress adjourn without passing the One-Term
Amendment to the Constitution. There has never been so favorable
an opportunity. All parties are in favor of it.…
<i>General Grant is in favor of it.</i> The party which supports
General Grant demands it; and above all else public morality
calls for it.”</p>

</div>

<p>Considering that these pledges were made by an organ
of the party, and in his very presence, they may be
accepted as proceeding from him. His name must be
added to the list with Andrew Jackson, William Henry
Harrison, Henry Clay, and Benjamin F. Wade, all of
whom are enrolled against the reëligibility of a President.</p>

<p>But his example as President is more than his testimony
in showing the necessity of this limitation. Andrew
Jackson did not hesitate to say that it was required
in order to place the President “beyond the reach of
any improper influences,” and “uncommitted to any
other course than the strict line of constitutional duty.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
William Henry Harrison followed in declaring that with
the adoption of this principle “the incumbent would devote
all his time to the public interest, and there would
be no cause to misrule the country.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Henry Clay was
satisfied, after much observation and reflection, “that too
much of the time, the thoughts, and the exertions of the
incumbent are occupied during his first term in securing
his reëlection.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Benjamin F. Wade, after denouncing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the reëligibility of the President, said: “There are defects
in the Constitution, and this is among the most
glaring.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>And now our President by his example, besides his
testimony, vindicates all these authorities. He makes
us see how all that has been predicted of Presidents
seeking reëlection is fulfilled: how this desire dominates
official conduct; how naturally the resources of the
Government are employed to serve a personal purpose;
how the national interests are subordinate to individual
advancement; how all questions, foreign or domestic,
whether of treaties or laws, are handled with a view to
electoral votes; how the appointing power lends itself
to a selfish will, acting now by the temptation of office
and then by the menace of removal; and, since every
office-holder and every office-seeker has a brevet commission
in the predominant political party, how the
President, desiring reëlection, becomes the active head
of three coöperating armies,&mdash;the army of office-holders,
eighty thousand strong, the larger army of office-seekers,
and the army of the political party, the whole constituting
a consolidated power which no candidate can possess
without peril to his country. Of these vast coöperating
armies the President is commander-in-chief and
generalissimo. Through these he holds in submission
even Representatives and Senators, and makes the country
his vassal with a condition not unlike that of martial
law, where the disobedient are shot, while the various
rings help secure the prize. That this is not too
strong appears from testimony before a Senate Committee,
where a Presidential lieutenant boldly denounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
an eminent New York citizen, who was a prominent
candidate for Governor, as “obnoxious to General Grant,”&mdash;and
then, with an effrontery like the Presidential pretension,
announced that “President Grant was the representative
and head of the Republican Party, and all
good Republicans should support him in all his measures
and appointments, and any one who did not do it
should be <i>crushed out</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Such things teach how wise
were those statesmen who would not subject the President
to the temptation or even the suspicion of using
his vast powers in promoting personal ends.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the One-Man Power has increased
latterly beyond example,&mdash;owing partly to the greater
facilities of intercourse, especially by telegraph, so that
the whole country is easily reached,&mdash;partly to improvements
in organization, by which distant places
are brought into unity,&mdash;and partly through the protracted
prevalence of the military spirit created by the
war. There was a time in English history when the
House of Commons, on the motion of the famous lawyer
Mr. Dunning, adopted the resolution, “That the influence
of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought
to be diminished.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The same declaration is needed
with regard to the President; and the very words of the
Parliamentary patriot may be repeated. In his memorable
speech, Mr. Dunning, after saying that he did not
rest “upon proof idle to require,” declared that the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
“must be decided by the consciences of those who
as a jury were called upon to determine what was or
was not within their own knowledge.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> It was on
ground of notoriety cognizable to all that he acted.
And precisely on this ground, but also with specific
proofs, do I insist that the influence of the President
has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished.
But in this excellent work, well worthy the best efforts
of all, nothing is more important than the limitation to
one term.</p>

<p>There is a demand for reform in the civil service, and
the President formally adopts this demand; but he
neglects the first step, which depends only on himself.
From this we may judge his little earnestness in the
cause. Beyond all question Civil-Service Reform must
begin by a limitation of the President to one term, so
that the temptation to use the appointing power for
personal ends may disappear from our system, and this
great disturbing force cease to exist. If the President
is sincere for reform, it will be easy for him to set the
example by declaring again his adhesion to the One-Term
principle. But even if he fails, we must do our
duty.</p>

<p>Therefore, in opposing the prolonged power of the
present incumbent, I begin by insisting, that, for the
good of the country, and without reference to any personal
failure, no President should be a candidate for
reëlection; and it is our duty now to set an example
worthy of republican institutions. In the name of the
One-Term principle, once recognized by him, and which
needs no other evidence of its necessity than his own
Presidency, I protest against his attempt to obtain
another lease of power. But this protest is on the
threshold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<h4>HIS UNFITNESS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE.</h4>

<p>I protest against him as radically unfit for the Presidential
office, being essentially military in nature, without
experience in civil life, without aptitude for civil
duties, and without knowledge of republican institutions,&mdash;all
of which is perfectly apparent, unless we
are ready to assume that the matters and things set
forth to-day are of no account, and then, in further support
of the candidate, boldly declare that nepotism in a
President is nothing, that gift-taking with repayment in
official patronage is nothing, that violation of the Constitution
and of International and Municipal Law is
nothing, that indignity to the African race is nothing,
that quarrel with political associates is nothing, and
that all his Presidential pretensions in their motley aggregation,
being a new Cæsarism or personal government,
are nothing. But if these are all nothing, then is
the Republican Party nothing, nor is there any safeguard
for Republican Institutions.</p>

<h4>APOLOGIES FOR THE PRESIDENT.</h4>

<p>Two apologies I hear. The first is that he means
well, and errs from want of knowledge. This is not
much. It was said of Louis the Quarreller, that he
meant well; nor is there a slate head-stone in any village
burial-ground that does not record as much of the
humble lodger beneath. Something more is needed for
a President. Nor can we afford to perpetuate power in
a ruler who errs so much from ignorance. Charity for
the past I concede, but no investiture for the future.</p>

<p>The other apology is, that his Presidency has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
successful. How? When? Where? Not to him can
be attributed that general prosperity which is the natural
outgrowth of our people and country; for his contribution
is not traced in the abounding result. Our golden fields,
productive mines, busy industry, diversified commerce,
owe nothing to him. Show, then, his success. Is it in
the finances? The national debt has been reduced, but
not to so large an amount as by Andrew Johnson in the
same space of time. Little merit is due to either, for
each employed the means allowed by Congress. To the
American people is this reduction due, and not to any
President. And while our President in this respect is
no better than his predecessor, he can claim no merit
for any systematic effort to reduce taxation or restore
specie payments. Perhaps, then, it is in foreign relations
that he claims the laurels he is to wear. Knowing
something of these from careful study and years of practical
acquaintance, I am bound to say that never before
has their management been so wanting in ability and so
absolutely without character. With so much pretension
and so little knowledge, how could it be otherwise?
Here the President touches nothing which he does not
muddle. In every direction is muddle,&mdash;muddle with
Spain, muddle with Cuba, muddle with the Black Republic,
muddle with distant Corea, muddle with Venezuela,
muddle with Russia, muddle with England,&mdash;on
all sides one diversified muddle. If there is not
muddle with Germany and France, it must be from
their forbearance. To this condition are we reduced.
When before in our history have we reached any such
bathos as that to which we have been carried in our
questions with England? Are these the laurels for a
Presidential candidate?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>But where else shall we look for them? Are
they found on the Indian frontier? Let the cry of
massacre and blood from that distant region answer.
Are they in reform of the civil service? But here the
initial point is the limitation of the President to one
term, so that he may be placed above temptation; yet
this he opposes. Evidently he is no true reformer.
Are these laurels found in the administration of the
Departments? Let the discreditable sale of arms to
France in violation of neutral duties and of municipal
statute be the answer; and let the custom-houses of
New York and New Orleans, with their tales of favoritism
and of nepotism, and with their prostitution as
agencies, mercenary and political, echo back the answer;
while senatorial committees, organized contrary to a cardinal
principle of Parliamentary Law as a cover to these
scandals, testify also. And again, let the War Department
recall the disappearance of important archives
bearing on an important event of the war, so that empty
boxes remain like a coffin without a corpse. Where,
then, are the laurels? At last I find them, fresh and
brilliant, in the harmony which the President has preserved
among Republicans. Harmony, do I say? This
should have been his congenial task; nor would any aid
or homage of mine have been wanting. But instead he
has organized discord, operating through a succession of
rings, and for laurels we find only weeds and thistles.</p>

<p>But I hear that he is successful in the States once
in rebellion. Strange that this should be said while
we are harrowed by the reports of Ku-Klux outrages.
Here, as in paying the national debt, Congress has been
the effective power. Even the last extraordinary measure
became necessary, in my judgment, to supplement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
his little efficiency. Had the President put into the
protection of the colored people at the South half the
effort and earnest will with which he maintained his
San Domingo contrivance, the murderous Ku-Klux
would have been driven from the field and peace assured.
Nor has he ever exhibited to the colored people
any true sympathy. His conduct to Frederick Douglass
on his return from San Domingo is an illustration; and
so also was his answer to the committee of colored fellow-citizens
seeking his countenance for the pending
measure of Civil Rights. Some thought him indifferent;
others found him insulting. Then came his recent letter
to the great meeting at Washington, May 9, 1872,
called to assert these rights, where he could say nothing
more than this: “I beg to assure you, however, that I
sympathize most cordially in any effort to secure for all
our people, of whatever race, nativity, or color, <i>the exercise
of those rights to which every citizen should be entitled</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
Of course everybody is in favor of “the rights
to which every citizen should be entitled.” But what
are these rights? And this meaningless juggle of words,
entirely worthy of the days of Slavery, is all that is
vouchsafed by a Republican President for the equal
rights of his colored fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>I dismiss the apologies with the conclusion, that in
the matters to which they invite attention his Presidency
is an enormous failure.</p>

<h4>THE PRESIDENT AS CANDIDATE.</h4>

<p>Looking at his daily life as it becomes known through
the press or conversation, his chief employment seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the dispensation of patronage, unless society is an employment.
For this he is visited daily by Senators and
Representatives bringing distant constituents. The Executive
Mansion has become that famous “Treasury
trough” described so well by an early Congressional
orator:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Such running, such jostling, such wriggling, such clambering
over one another’s backs, such squealing, because the
tub is so narrow and the company is so crowded.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To sit behind is the Presidential occupation, watching
and feeding the animals. If this were an amusement
only, it might be pardoned; but it must be seen in a
more serious light. Some nations are governed by the
sword,&mdash;in other words, by central force commanding
obedience. Our President governs by offices,&mdash;in other
words, by the appointing power, being a central force by
which he coerces obedience to his personal will. Let a
Senator or Representative hesitate in the support of his
autocracy, or doubt if he merits a second term, and forthwith
some distant consul or postmaster, appointed by
his influence, begins to tremble. The “Head Centre”
makes himself felt to the most distant circumference.
Can such tyranny, where the military spirit of our President
finds a congenial field, be permitted to endure?</p>

<p>In adopting him as a candidate for reëlection we undertake
to vindicate his Presidency, and adopt in all
things the insulting, incapable, aide-de-campish dictatorship
which he has inaugurated. Presenting his name,
we vouch for his fitness, not only in original nature, but
in experience of civil life, in aptitude for civil duties, in
knowledge of republican institutions, and elevation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
purpose; and we must be ready to defend openly what
he has openly done. Can Republicans honestly do this
thing? Let it be said that he is not only the greatest
nepotist among Presidents, but greater than all others
together, and what Republican can reply? Let it
be said that he is not only the greatest gift-taker
among Presidents, but the only one who repaid his
patrons at the public expense, and what Republican
can reply? Let it be said that he has openly violated
the Constitution and International Law, in the prosecution
of a wretched contrivance against the peace of San
Domingo, and what Republican can reply? Let it be
said, that, wielding the power of the Great Republic, he
has insulted the Black Republic with a menace of war,
involving indignity to the African Race, and what Republican
can reply? Let it be said that he has set up
Presidential pretensions without number, constituting
an undoubted Cæsarism or personal government, and
what Republican can reply? And let it be added, that,
unconscious of all this misrule, he quarrels without cause
even with political supporters, and on such a scale as to
become the greatest Presidential quarreller of our history,
quarrelling more than all other Presidents together,
and what Republican can reply? It will not be enough
to say that he was triumphant in war,&mdash;as Scipio, the
victor of Hannibal, reminded the Roman people that on
this day he conquered at Zama.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Others have been triumphant
in war and failed in civil life,&mdash;as Marlborough,
whose heroic victories seemed unaccountable, in
the frivolity, the ignorance, and the heartlessness of his
pretended statesmanship. To Washington was awarded
that rarest tribute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> “First in war, first in peace, and first
in the hearts of his countrymen.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Of our President it
will be said willingly, “first in war,” but the candid historian
will add, “first in nepotism, first in gift-taking
and repaying by official patronage, first in Presidential
pretensions, and first in quarrel with his countrymen.”</p>

<p>Anxiously, earnestly, the country asks for reform, and
stands tiptoe to greet the coming. But how expect reform
from a President who needs it so much himself?
Who shall reform the reformer? So also does the country
ask for purity. But is it not vain to seek this boon
from one whose Presidential pretensions are so demoralizing?
Who shall purify the purifier? The country
asks for reform in the civil service. But how expect
any such change from one who will not allow the Presidential
office to be secured against its worst temptation?
The country desires an example for the youth of the
land, where intelligence shall blend with character, and
both be elevated by a constant sense of duty with unselfish
devotion to the public weal. But how accord
this place to a President who makes his great office a
plaything and perquisite, while his highest industry is
in quarrelling? Since Sancho Panza at Barataria, no
Governor has provided so well for his relations at the
expense of his country; and if any other has made Cabinet
appointments the return for personal favors, his
name has dropped out of history. A man is known by
his acts; so also by the company he keeps. And is not
our President known by his intimacy with those who
are by-words of distrust? But all these by-words look
to another term for perpetuation of their power. Therefore,
for the sake of reform and purity, which are a longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of the people, and also that the Chief Magistrate
may be an example, we must seek a remedy.</p>

<p>See for one moment how pernicious must be the Presidential
example. First in place, his personal influence
is far-reaching beyond that of any other citizen. What
he does others will do. What he fails to do others will
fail to do. His standard of conduct will be accepted at
least by his political supporters. His measure of industry
and his sense of duty will be the pattern for the
country. If he appoints relations to office and repays
gifts by official patronage, making his Presidency a great
“gift-enterprise,” may not every office-holder do likewise,
each in his sphere, so that nepotism and gift-taking
with official remuneration will be general, and gift-enterprises
be multiplied indefinitely in the public service?
If he treats his trust as plaything and perquisite, why
may not every office-holder do the same? If he disregards
Constitution and Law in the pursuit of personal
objects, how can we expect a just subordination from
others? If he sets up pretensions without number repugnant
to republican institutions, must not the good
cause suffer? If he is stubborn, obstinate, and perverse,
are not stubbornness, obstinacy, and perversity commended
for imitation? If he insults and wrongs associates
in official trust, who is safe from the malignant
influence having its propulsion from the Executive
Mansion? If he fraternizes with jobbers and Hessians,
where is the limit to the demoralization that must
ensue? Necessarily the public service takes its character
from its elected chief, and the whole country
reflects the President. His example is a law. But a
bad example must be corrected as a bad law.</p>

<p>To the Republican Party, devoted to ideas and principles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
I turn now with more than ordinary solicitude.
Not willingly can I see it sacrificed. Not without earnest
effort against the betrayal can I suffer its ideas and
principles to be lost in the personal pretensions of one
man. Both the old parties are in a crisis, with this difference
between the two: the Democracy is dissolving,
the Republican party is being absorbed; the Democracy
is falling apart, thus visibly losing its vital unity,&mdash;the
Republican Party is submitting to a personal influence,
thus visibly losing its vital character; the Democracy is
ceasing to exist, the Republican Party is losing its identity.
Let the process be completed, and it will be no
longer that Republican Party which I helped to found
and have always served, but only a personal party,&mdash;while
instead of those ideas and principles which we
have been so proud to uphold will be Presidential pretensions,
and instead of Republicanism there will be nothing
but Grantism.</p>

<p>Political parties are losing their sway. Higher than
party are country and the duty to save it from Cæsar.
The Caucus is at last understood as a political engine
moved by wire-pullers, and it becomes more insupportable
in proportion as directed to personal ends. Nor is
its character changed when called a National Convention.
Here, too, are wire-pullers; and when the great
Office-Holder and the great Office-Seeker are one and
the same, it is easy to see how naturally the engine responds
to the central touch. A political convention is
an agency and convenience, but never a law, least of all
a despotism; and when it seeks to impose a candidate
whose name is a synonym of pretensions unrepublican
in character and hostile to good government, it will be
for earnest Republicans to consider well how clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
party is subordinate to country. Such a nomination
can have no just obligation. Therefore with unspeakable
interest will the country watch the National Convention
at Philadelphia. It may be an assembly (and
such is my hope) where ideas and principles are above
all personal pretensions, and the unity of the party is
symbolized in the candidate; or it may add another to
Presidential rings, being an expansion of the military
ring at the Executive Mansion, the senatorial ring in
this Chamber, and the political ring in the custom-houses
of New York and New Orleans. A National
Convention which is a Presidential ring cannot represent
the Republican Party.</p>

<p>Much rather would I see the party to which I am
dedicated, under the image of a life-boat not to be sunk
by wind or wave. How often have I said this to cheer
my comrades! I do not fear the Democratic Party.
Nothing from them can harm our life-boat. But I do
fear a quarrelsome pilot, unused to the sea, but pretentious
in command, who occupies himself in loading
aboard his own unserviceable relations and personal patrons,
while he drives away the experienced seamen
who know the craft and her voyage. Here is a peril
which no life-boat can stand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I wait the determination of the National
Convention, where are delegates from my own much-honored
Commonwealth with whom I rejoice to act.
Not without anxiety do I wait, but with the earnest
hope that the Convention will bring the Republican
Party into ancient harmony, saving it especially from
the suicidal folly of an issue on the personal pretensions
of one man.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, July 29, 1872.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen and Fellow-Citizens</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">If I have delayed answering your communication of
July 11th, which was duly placed in my hands by
your committee, it was not because the proper course
for you seemed doubtful, but because I wished to reflect
upon it and be aided by information which time might
supply. Since then I have carefully considered the inquiries
addressed to me, and have listened to much on
both sides; but my best judgment now is in harmony
with my early conclusion.</p>

<p>I am touched by the appeal you make. It is true
that I am the friend of your race, and I am glad to be
assured that in your opinion I have held a consistent
course in the Senate and elsewhere as the special advocate
of your rights. That course, by the blessing of
God, I mean to hold so long as life lasts. I know your
infinite wrongs, and feel for them as my own. You
only do me simple justice, when you add a belief that
my counsel at this critical juncture of your citizenship
“would be free from personal feelings and partisan prejudice.”
In answering your inquiries I can have no sentiment
except for your good, which I most anxiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
seek; nor can any disturbing influence be allowed to
interfere. The occasion is too solemn. Especially is
there no room for personal feeling or for partisan prejudice.
No man or party can expect power except for the
general welfare. Therefore they must be brought to the
standard of truth, which is without feeling or prejudice.</p>

<h4>QUESTIONS PROPOSED.</h4>

<p>You are right in saying that the choice for the Presidency
is now “narrowed down” to President Grant or
Horace Greeley. One of these is to be taken, and, assuming
my acquaintance with both and my observation
of their lives, you invite my judgment between them,
asking me especially which of the two, “<i>judging from
their antecedents as well as present position</i>,” would enforce
the Constitution and laws securing your civil and
political rights “with <i>the most heart-felt sympathy and the
greatest vigor</i>.” Here I remark that in this inquiry you
naturally put your rights in the foreground. So do I,&mdash;believing
most sincerely that the best interests of the
whole country are associated with the completest recognition
of your rights, so that the two races shall live together
in unbroken harmony. I also remark that you
call attention to two things,&mdash;the “antecedents” of the
candidates, and their “present position.” You wish to
know from these which gives assurance of the most
heart-felt sympathy and greatest vigor in the maintenance
of your rights,&mdash;in other words, which, judging
by the past, will be your truest friend.</p>

<p>The communication with which you have honored me
is not alone. Colored fellow-citizens in other parts of
the country, I may say in nearly every State of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Union, have made a similar request, and some complain
that I have thus far kept silent. I am not insensible to
the trust reposed in me. But if my opinion is given, it
must be candidly, according to my conscience. In this
spirit I answer your inquiries, beginning with the antecedents
of the two candidates.</p>

<h4>ANTECEDENTS OF THE CANDIDATES.</h4>

<p>Horace Greeley was born to poverty and educated
himself in a printing-office. President Grant, fortunate
in early patronage, became a cadet at West Point
and was educated at the public expense. One started
with nothing but industry and character; the other
started with a military commission. One was trained
as a civilian; the other as a soldier. Horace Greeley
stood forth as a Reformer and Abolitionist. President
Grant enlisted as a Proslavery Democrat, and, at the
election of James Buchanan, fortified by his vote all the
pretensions of Slavery, including the Dred Scott decision.
Horace Greeley from early life was earnest and constant
against Slavery, full of sympathy with the colored race,
and always foremost in the great battle for their rights.
President Grant, except as a soldier summoned by the
terrible accident of war, never did anything against
Slavery, nor has he at any time shown any sympathy
with the colored race, but rather indifference, if not
aversion. Horace Greeley earnestly desired that colored
citizens should vote, and ably championed impartial suffrage;
but President Grant was on the other side.</p>

<p>Beyond these contrasts, which are marked, it cannot
be forgotten that Horace Greeley is a person of large
heart and large understanding, trained to the support of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Human Rights, always beneficent to the poor, always
ready for any good cause, and never deterred by opposition
or reproach, as when for long years he befriended
your people. Add to these qualities, conspicuous in his
life, untiring industry which leaves no moment without
its fruit, abundant political knowledge, acquaintance
with history, the instinct and grasp of statesmanship,
an amiable nature, a magnanimous soul, and above all
an honesty which no suspicion has touched,&mdash;and you
have a brief portraiture where are antecedents of Horace
Greeley.</p>

<p>Few of these things appear in the President. His
great success in war, and the honors he has won, cannot
change the record of his conduct toward your people,
especially in contrast with the life-time fidelity of his
competitor, while there are unhappy “antecedents”
showing that in the prosecution of his plans he cares
nothing for the colored race. The story is painful; but
it must be told.</p>

<h4>GRANT’S INDIGNITY TO THE COLORED RACE.</h4>

<p>I refer to the outrage he perpetrated upon Hayti,
with its six hundred thousand blacks engaged in the
great experiment of self-government. Here is a most
instructive “antecedent,” revealing beyond question his
true nature, and the whole is attested by documentary
evidence. Conceiving the idea of annexing Dominica,
which is the Spanish part of the island, and shrinking
at nothing, he began by seizing the war powers of the
Government, in flagrant violation of the Constitution,
and then, at great expenditure of money, sent several
armed ships of the Navy, including monitors, to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the usurper Baez in power, that through him he
might obtain the coveted prize. Not content with this
audacious dictatorship, he proceeded to strike at the
independence of the Black Republic by open menace
of war, and all without the sanction of Congress, to
which is committed the power to make war. Sailing
into the harbor of Port-au-Prince with our most powerful
monitor, the Dictator, (properly named for this
service,) also the frigate Severn as consort, and other
monitors in their train, the Admiral, acting under instructions
from Washington, proceeded to the Executive
Mansion accompanied by officers of his squadron, and
then, pointing to the great war-ships in sight from the
windows, dealt his unjust menace, threatening to sink
or capture Haytian ships. The President was black, not
white. The Admiral would have done no such thing to
any white ruler, nor would our country have tolerated
such menace from any Government in the world. Here
was indignity not only to the Black Republic with its
population of six hundred thousand, but to the African
race everywhere, and especially in our own country.
Nor did it end here. For months the Navy of the
United States was kept hovering on the coast, holding
that insulted people in constant dread and anxiety,
while President Grant was to them like a hawk sailing
in the air, ready to swoop upon his prey.</p>

<h4>FALSE IMPRISONMENT OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.</h4>

<p>This heartless, cruel proceeding found a victim among
our white fellow-citizens. An excellent merchant of
Connecticut, praised by all who know him, was plunged
into prison by Baez, where he was immured because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
was feared that on his return to New York he would
expose the frauds of the plotters; and this captivity was
prolonged with the connivance of two agents of the
President, one of whom finds constant favor with him
and is part of the military ring immediately about him.
That such an outrage could go unpunished shows the
little regard of the President for human rights, whether
in white or black.</p>

<h4>HARD TO BEAR THESE OUTRAGES.</h4>

<p>I confess my trials, as I was called to witness these
things. Always a supporter of the Administration, and
sincerely desiring to labor with it, I had never uttered
a word with regard to it except in kindness. My early
opposition to the Treaty of Annexion was reserved,
so that for some time my opinions were unknown. It
was only when I saw the breach of all law, human and
divine, that I was aroused; and then began the anger of
the President and of his rings, military and senatorial.
Devoted to the African race, I felt for them,&mdash;besides
being humbled that the Great Republic, acting through
its President, could set such an example, where the National
Constitution, International Law, and Humanity
were all sacrificed. Especially was I moved when I saw
the indignity to the colored race, which was accomplished
by trampling upon a fundamental principle of
International Law, declaring the equality of nations, as
our Declaration of Independence declares the equality
of men.</p>

<p>This terrible transaction, which nobody can defend, is
among the “antecedents” of President Grant, from which
you can judge how much the colored race can rely upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
his “heart-felt sympathy.” Nor can it be forgotten that
shortly afterward, on the return of the Commission from
this island, Hon. Frederick Douglass, the colored orator,
accomplished in manners as in eloquence, was thrust
away from the company of the Commissioners at the
common table of the mail-packet on the Potomac, almost
within sight of the Executive Mansion, simply on
account of his color; but the President, at whose invitation
he had joined the Commission, never uttered a
word in condemnation of this exclusion, and when entertaining
the returned Commissioners at dinner carefully
omitted Mr. Douglass, who was in Washington at
the time, and thus repeated the indignity.</p>

<h4>OTHER ANTECEDENTS.</h4>

<p>Other things might be mentioned, showing the sympathies
of the President; but I cannot forget the Civil
Rights Bill, which is the cap-stone of that Equality before
the Law to which all are entitled without distinction
of color. President Grant, who could lobby so assiduously
for his San Domingo scheme, full of wrong to
the colored race, could do nothing for this beneficent
measure. During a long session of Congress it was discussed
constantly, and the colored people everywhere
hung upon the debate; but there was no word of “heart-felt
sympathy” from the President. At last, just before
the Nominating Convention, he addressed a letter to a
meeting of colored fellow-citizens in Washington, called
to advance this cause, where he avoided the question
by declaring himself in favor of “the exercise of those
rights to which every citizen should be entitled,”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
it uncertain whether colored people are justly entitled
to the rights secured by the pending bill. I understand
that Horace Greeley has been already assailed
by an impracticable Democrat as friendly to this bill;
but nobody has lisped against President Grant on this
account.</p>

<p>Among “antecedents” I deem it my duty to mention
the little capacity or industry of the President in protecting
colored people and in assuring peace at the South.
Nobody can doubt that a small portion of the effort and
earnest will, even without the lobbying, so freely given
to the San Domingo scheme, would have averted those
Ku-Klux outrages which we deplore,&mdash;thus superseding
all pretence for further legislation by Congress. But
he is disabled both by character and the drawback of
his own conduct. After violating the Constitution and
International Law to insult the Black Republic, and setting
an example of insubordination, he is not in condition
to rebuke law-breakers.</p>

<h4>PRESENT POSITION OF CANDIDATES.</h4>

<p>Passing from “antecedents,” I come now to the “present
position” of the two candidates, which is the subject
of your next inquiry. If in any formal particulars the
two are on equality, yet in all substantial respects the
obvious advantage is with Horace Greeley.</p>

<h4>NOMINATIONS OF THE TWO CANDIDATES.</h4>

<p>Each was nominated by a Republican Convention,
one at Cincinnati and the other at Philadelphia; so that
in this respect they may seem to be on equality. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
it will not fail to be observed that the Convention at
Cincinnati was composed of able and acknowledged
Republicans, many having acted with the party from
its first formation, who, without previous organization,
came together voluntarily for the sake of Reform and
Purity in the Government; while, on the other hand,
the Convention at Philadelphia was composed of delegates
chosen largely under the influence of office-holders,
who assembled to sustain what is known as Grantism,
being the personal government and personal pretensions
of President Grant, involving nepotism, repayment of
gifts by official patronage, neglect of public duty, absenteeism,
quarrelling, military rule, disregard of Constitution
and Law, with general unfitness, and indignity
to the colored race,&mdash;all of which is so unrepublican
as to make its support impossible for true Republicans.
Therefore the Convention at Philadelphia, though calling
itself Republican, was less Republican in reality than
that at Cincinnati.</p>

<h4>THE TWO PLATFORMS.</h4>

<p>The two platforms, so far as concerns especially the
colored race, are alike in substance; but that of Cincinnati
is expressed in terms more worthy of the equal
rights it states and claims: “We recognize the equality
of all men before the law, and hold that it is the duty
of Government, in its dealings with the people, to mete
out equal and exact justice to all, of whatever nativity,
race, color, or persuasion, religious or political.” In
other respects the platform of Cincinnati is the more
republican, inasmuch as it sets itself against those unrepublican
abuses which have been nursed by the President
into pernicious activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<h4>SUPPORTERS OF THE TWO CANDIDATES.</h4>

<p>From the two nominations and two platforms I come
to the supporters of the candidates; and here I look,
first, at those immediately about them, and, secondly, at
the popular support behind.</p>

<p>Horace Greeley has among his immediate supporters,
in all parts of the country, devoted and consistent
Republicans, always earnest for Reform and Purity in
Government, on whose lives there is no shadow of suspicion,&mdash;being
a contrast in character to those rings
which play such a part in the present Administration.
The country knows too well the Military Ring, the Senatorial
Ring, and the Custom-House Ring, through which
the President acts. Such supporters are a poor recommendation.</p>

<h4>DEMOCRATS TURNING REPUBLICANS.</h4>

<p>Looking at the popular support behind, the advantage
is still with Horace Greeley. President Grant has
at his back the diversified army of office-holders, drilled
to obey the word of command. The speeches praising
him are by office-holders and members of rings. Horace
Greeley finds flocking to his cause large numbers of Republicans
unwilling to continue the existing misrule,
and as allies with them a regenerated party springing
forward to unite in this liberal movement. Democrats,
in joining Horace Greeley, have changed simply as President
Grant changed when he joined the Republicans,&mdash;except
that he was rewarded at once with high office.
The change is open. Adopting the Republican platform,
which places the Equal Rights of All under the safeguard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
of irreversible guaranties, and at the same time
accepting the nomination of a life-time Abolitionist, who
represents preëminently the sentiment of duty to the
colored race, they have set their corporate seal to the
sacred covenant. They may continue Democrats in
name, but they are in reality Republicans, by the same
title that those who sustain Republican principles are
Republicans,&mdash;or rather they are Democrats, according
to the original signification of that word, dedicated to
the rights of the people.</p>

<p>It is idle to say that Horace Greeley and the Republicans
who nominated him are any less Republican because
Democrats unite with them in support of cherished
principles and the candidate who represents them.
Conversions are always welcome, and not less so because
the change is in a multitude rather than an individual.
A political party cannot, if it would, and should not, if
it could, shut the door against converts, whether counted
by the score, the hundred, or the thousand; and so we
find that the supporters of President Grant announce
with partisan triumph the adhesion of a single Democratic
politician or a single Democratic newspaper. On
equal reason and with higher pride may the supporters
of Horace Greeley announce the adhesion of the Democratic
party, which, turning from the things that are behind,
presses on to those that are before.</p>

<h4>GREELEY’S ELECTION THE TRIUMPH OF REPUBLICAN
PRINCIPLES.</h4>

<p>It is also idle to say that the election of Horace Greeley
as President, with Gratz Brown as Vice-President,
both unchangeable Republicans, will be the return of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the Democratic party to power. On the contrary, it
will be the inauguration of Republican principles, under
the safeguard of a Republican President and Republican
Vice-President, with Democrats as avowed supporters.
In the organization of his Administration, and in
the conduct of affairs, Horace Greeley will naturally
lean upon those who represent best the great promises
of Equal Rights and Reconciliation made at Cincinnati.
If Democrats are taken, it will be as Republicans in
heart, recognizing the associate terms of the settlement
as an immutable finality.</p>

<p>The hardihood of political falsehood reaches its extreme
point, when it is asserted that under Horace
Greeley the freedmen will be reënslaved, or that colored
people will in any way suffer in their equal rights.
On the contrary, they have in his election not only the
promises of the platform, but also his splendid example
for a full generation, during which he has never wavered
in the assertion of their rights. To suppose that
Horace Greeley, when placed where he can do them the
most good, will depart from the rule of his honest life
is an insult to reason.</p>

<p>It is none the less idle to suppose that Democrats
supporting Horace Greeley expect or desire that he
should depart from those principles which are the glory
of his character. They have accepted the Cincinnati
platform with its twofold promises, and intend in good
faith to maintain it. Democrats cannot turn back, who
at the Convention adopting this platform sang Greeley
songs to the tune of “Old John Brown, his soul is
marching on.” Seeking especially the establishment of
character in the National Government, they will expect
their President to be always true to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore I put aside the partisan allegations, that
Horace Greeley has gone to the Democrats, or that he
will be controlled by Democrats. Each is without foundation
or reason, according to my judgment. They are
attempts to avoid what you recognize as the true issue,
being the question between the two candidates; or perhaps
they may be considered as scarecrows to deter the
timid. Nobody who votes for Horace Greeley will go
to the Democrats; nor do I believe, that, when elected,
Horace Greeley will be under any influence except that
enlightened conscience which will keep him ever true
to the principles he represents.</p>

<p>The conclusion from this comparison between the
two candidates is plain. Unquestionably the surest
trust of the colored people is in Horace Greeley. In
everything for your protection and advancement he
will show always the most heart-felt sympathy and
the greatest vigor beyond what can be expected from
President Grant. He is your truest friend.</p>

<h4>VOTE FOR GREELEY.</h4>

<p>Gentlemen, in thus answering your two inquiries, I
have shown why you, as colored fellow-citizens, and also
all who would uphold your rights and save the colored
race from indignity, should refuse to sanction the reëlection
of the President, and should put trust in Horace
Greeley. I ought to add, that with him will be associated
as Vice-President Gratz Brown, whom I have
known for years as a most determined Abolitionist.
The two together will carry into the National Government
an unswerving devotion to your rights, not to be
disturbed by partisan dictation or sectional prejudice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides all this, which may fitly guide you in determining
between the two candidates, it is my duty to
remind you, that, as citizens of the United States, and
of part of the country, your welfare is indissolubly associated
with that of the whole country. Where all are
prosperous you will be gainers. Therefore, while justly
careful of your own rights, you cannot be indifferent to
the blessings of good government. It is for you to consider
whether the time has not come for something better
than the sword, and whether a character like Horace
Greeley does not give stronger assurance of good government
than can be found in the insulter of the colored
race, already famous for the rings about him and his
plain inaptitude for civil life. The supporters of President
Grant compel us to observe his offences and shortcomings,
and thus the painful contrast with Horace
Greeley becomes manifest. It will be for others in the
present canvass to hold it before the American people.</p>

<h4>TOO MUCH OF A REPUBLICAN TO VOTE FOR GRANT.</h4>

<p>Speaking now for myself, I have to say that my vote
will be given for Horace Greeley; but in giving it I do
not go to the Democratic party, nor am I any less a Republican.
On the contrary, I am so much of a Republican
that I cannot support a candidate whose conduct
in civil life shows an incapacity to appreciate Republican
principles, and whose Administration is marked by
acts of delinquency, especially toward the colored race,
by the side of which the allegations on the impeachment
of Andrew Johnson were technical and trivial. Unquestionably
President Grant deserved impeachment for
high crimes and misdemeanors, rather than a renomination;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and on the trial it would have been enough to exhibit
his seizure of the war powers, and his indignity to
the Black Republic with its population of six hundred
thousand, in violation of the National Constitution and
of International Law. And here a contrast arises between
him and Abraham Lincoln. The latter in his first
Annual Message recommended the recognition of what
he called “the independence and sovereignty of Hayti”;
but it is at these that President Grant has struck. One
of Abraham Lincoln’s earliest acts was to put the Black
Republic on an equality with other powers; one of
President Grant’s earliest acts was to degrade it.</p>

<p>I am so much of a Republican that I wish to see in
the Presidential chair a life-time Abolitionist. I also
wish a President sincerely devoted to Civil-Service Reform,
beginning with the “One-Term Principle,” which
President Grant once accepted, but now disowns. I also
wish a President who sets the example of industry and
unselfish dedication to the public good. And I wish to
see a President through whom we may expect peace and
harmony, instead of discord. Strangely, President Grant
seems to delight in strife. If he finds no enemy, he falls
upon his friends,&mdash;as when he struck at the Black Republic,
insulted Russia in his last Annual Message, offended
both France and Germany, and then, in personal
relations, quarrelled generally.</p>

<h4>PRINCIPLES ABOVE PARTY.</h4>

<p>My own personal experience teaches how futile is the
charge, that, because Horace Greeley receives Democratic
votes, therefore he becomes a Democrat, or lapses under
Democratic control. I was first chosen to the Senate by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
a coalition of Free-Soilers and Democrats. Democratic
votes helped make me Senator from Massachusetts,&mdash;as
they also helped make my excellent friend Mr. Chase
Senator from Ohio, and will help make Horace Greeley
President. But neither Mr. Chase nor myself was on
this account less faithful as a Free-Soiler,&mdash;and, answering
for myself, I know that I never became a Democrat
or lapsed under Democratic control. I do not
doubt that Horace Greeley will be equally consistent.
The charge to the contrary, so vehemently repeated,
seems to reflect the character of those who make it,&mdash;except
that many repeat it by rote.</p>

<p>There is a common saying, “Principles, not Men”;
and on this ground an appeal is made for President
Grant, it being justly felt that in any personal comparison
with Horace Greeley he must fail. But a better saying
is, “Principles <i>and</i> Men.” I am for the principles of
the Republican Party in contradiction to Grantism, and
I am for the man who truly represents them. By these
principles I shall stand, for them I shall labor, and in
their triumph I shall always rejoice. If any valued
friend separates from me now, it will be because he
<i>places a man above principles</i>. Early in public life I declared
my little heed for party, and my indifference to
the name by which I was called; and now I confess my
want of sympathy with those who would cling to the
form after its spirit has fled.</p>

<h4>GREELEY’S NOMINATION A RESPONSE TO LONGING FOR
PEACE.</h4>

<p>This answer would be incomplete, if I did not call
attention to another and controlling consideration, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
cannot be neglected by the good citizen. Watching the
remarkable movement that has ended in the double
nomination of Horace Greeley, it is easy to see that it
did not proceed from politicians, whether at Cincinnati
or Baltimore. Evidently it was the heart of the people,
sorely wrung by war and the controversies it engendered,
which found this expression. Sir Philip Sidney
said of the uprising in the Netherlands, “It is the spirit
of the Lord, and is irresistible”; and such a spirit is
manifest now. I would not use the word lightly, but to
my mind it is Providential. Notwithstanding the counteracting
influence of politicians, Republican and Democratic,
in the face of persistent ridicule, and against the
extravagance of unscrupulous opposition, the nomination
at Cincinnati was triumphantly adopted at Baltimore.
Such an unprecedented victory, without concert or propulsion
of any kind, can be explained only by supposing
that it is in harmony with a popular longing. That
Democrats, and especially those of the South, should
adopt a life-time Abolitionist for President is an assurance
of willingness to associate the rights of their colored
fellow-citizens with that Reconciliation of which
Horace Greeley was an early representative. In standing
by Jefferson Davis at his trial and signing his bail-bond,
he showed the same sentiment of humanity he so
constantly displayed in standing by the colored race
throughout their prolonged trial; so that the two discordant
races find kindred hospitality in him, and he
thus becomes a tie of union. In harmony with this interesting
circumstance is the assurance in his letter of
acceptance, that, if elected, he will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> “the President,
not of a party, but of the whole people.”</p>

<h4>RECONCILIATION.</h4>

<p>The nomination has been adopted by the Democrats
in convention assembled. This was an event which the
supporters of President Grant declared impossible. I do
not see how it can be regarded otherwise than as a peace-offering.
As such it is of infinite value. The Past is
rejected, and a new Future is begun with the promise of
concord. Here is no ordinary incident. It is a Revolution,
and its success in pacifying the country will be
in proportion to its acceptance by us. I dare not neglect
the great opportunity, nor can I stand aloof. It is
in harmony with my life, which places Peace above all
things except the Rights of Man. Thus far, in constant
efforts for the colored race, I have sincerely sought the
good of all, which I was sure would be best obtained in
fulfilling the promises of the Declaration of Independence,
making all equal in rights. The spirit in which
I acted appears in an early speech, where I said: “Nothing
in hate; nothing in vengeance.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> My object was
security for Human Rights. Most anxiously I have
looked for the time, which seems now at hand, when
there should be reconciliation, not only between the
North and South, but between the two races, so that
the two sections and the two races may be lifted from
the ruts and grooves in which they are now fastened,
and, instead of <i>irritating antagonism</i> without end, there
shall be <i>sympathetic coöperation</i>.</p>

<p>The existing differences ought to be ended. There is
a time for all things, and we are admonished by a wide-spread
popular uprising, bursting the bonds of party, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the time has come for estrangement to cease between
people who by the ordinance of God must live together.
Gladly do I welcome the happy signs; nor can I observe
without regret the colored people in organized masses
resisting the friendly overtures, even to the extent of
intimidating those who are the other way. It is for
them to consider carefully whether they should not take
advantage of the unexpected opening, and recognize the
“bail-bond” given at Baltimore as the assurance of
peace, and unite with me in holding the parties to the
full performance of its conditions. Provided always that
their rights are fixed, I am sure it cannot be best for the
colored people to band together in a hostile camp, provoking
antagonism and keeping alive the separation of
races. Above all, there must be no intimidation; but
every voter must act freely, without constraint from
league or lodge. Much better will it be when the two
political parties compete for your votes, each anxious for
your support. Only then will that citizenship by which
you are entitled to the equal rights of all have its natural
fruits. Only then will there be that harmony which
is essential to a true civilization.</p>

<p>The present position of the colored citizen is perilous.
He is exposed to injurious pressure where he
needs support. But I see no early extrication except
in the way now proposed. Let him cut adrift from
managers who would wield him merely as a political
force, with little regard to his own good, and bravely
stand by the candidate who has stood by him. If
Democrats unite with him, so much the better. The
association, once begun, must naturally ripen in common
friendship and trust.</p>

<p>I am for peace in reality as in name. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
bottom of my heart I am for peace, and I welcome all
that makes for peace. With deep-felt satisfaction I remember
that no citizen who drew his sword against us
has suffered by the hand of the executioner. In just
association with this humanity will be the triumph of
Equal Rights, when the promises of the great Declaration
are all fulfilled, and our people are united, as never
before, in the enduring fellowship of a common citizenship.
To this end there must be Reconciliation. Nor
can I withhold my hand. Freely I accept the hand that
is offered, and reach forth my own in friendly grasp. I
am against the policy of hate; I am against fanning
ancient flames into continued life; I am against raking
the ashes of the Past for coals of fire yet burning.
Pile up the ashes; extinguish the flames; abolish the
hate!</p>

<p>And now, turning to the Democratic party, I hold it
to all the covenants solemnly given in the adoption of a
Republican platform with Horace Greeley as candidate.
There can be no backward step.</p>

<h4>WATCHWORD FOR THE CANVASS.</h4>

<p>With no common sympathy I observe that Mr. Hendricks,
a leading Democrat, whom I knew and esteemed
in the Senate, has recently announced his acceptance of
the Constitutional Amendments with their logical results.
He proposes, as a proper key-note to the popular
movement now swelling to a sure triumph, “Just Laws
and Public Virtue.” This is a worthy aspiration, entirely
fit for the occasion. My watchword is, “The Unity of
the Republic, and the Equal Rights of All, with Reconciliation.”
Such is my heart-felt cry; and wherever my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
voice can reach, there do I insist upon all these, humbly
invoking the blessings of Divine Providence, which, I
believe, must descend upon such a cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Accept my best wishes for yourselves personally, and
for the people you represent.</p>

<p>And believe me, Gentlemen,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 31, 1872, Mr. Blaine addressed a letter to Mr. Sumner through
the newspapers, arraigning him as recreant both to party and principle,
in the position taken by him on the Presidential question in his recent
Letter to Colored Citizens. Mr. Sumner responded as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, August 5, 1872.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have seen the letter addressed to
me by you through the public prints, and I notice
especially, that, while animadverting upon my support
of Horace Greeley, you say not one word in vindication
of that compound of pretensions known as
Grantism in contradistinction to Republicanism, which
you would install anew in the Government.</p>

<p>You are greatly concerned about the company I keep.
To quiet your solicitude, I beg leave to say, that, in joining
the Republicans who brought forward an original
Abolitionist, I find myself with so many others devoted
to the cause I have always served that I had not missed
you until you hastened to report absence; nor had I
taken account of the “Southern Secessionists,” who, as
you aver, are now coöperating with me in support of
this original Abolitionist, except to rejoice, that, if
among former associates some like yourself hesitate,
their places are supplied from an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>You entirely misunderstand me when you introduce
an incident of the past, and build on it an argument
why I should not support Horace Greeley. What has
Preston Brooks to do with the Presidential election?
Never, while a sufferer, did anybody hear me speak of
him in unkindness; and now, after the lapse of more
than half a generation, I will not unite with you in
dragging him from the grave, where he sleeps, to aggravate
the passions of a political conflict, and arrest the
longing for concord. And here is the essential difference
between you and me at this juncture. I seize the
opportunity to make the equal rights of all secure
through peace and reconciliation; but this infinite boon
you would postpone.</p>

<p>Seven years have passed since the close of our Civil
War; but, unhappily, during all this period a hostile
spirit has continued to exist between the contending
sections, while the rights of colored fellow-citizens have
been in perpetual question. Seven years mark a natural
period of human life. Should not the spirit be changed
with the body? Can we not after seven years begin a
new life, especially when those once our foes repeat the
saying, “Thy people shall be my people, and thy God
my God”?</p>

<p>I declare my preference for an original Abolitionist as
President, and you seek to create a diversion by crying
out that Democrats will support him. To which I reply,
So much the better. Their support is the assurance
that the cause he has so constantly guarded, whether of
Equal Rights or Reconciliation, is accepted by Democrats;
and this is the pledge of a true union beyond anything
in our history. It is a victory of ideas, without
which all other victories must fail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>To intensify your allegation, you insist that I am
ranged with Jefferson Davis and Robert Toombs; but,
pardon me, nobody knows how the former will vote,
while Robert Toombs is boisterous against Horace Greeley,
and with him are Stephens, Wise, and Mosby. This
is all very poor, and I mention it only to exhibit the
character of your attempt.</p>

<p>In the same spirit you seek to avoid the real issue by
holding up the possibility of what you call a Democratic
Administration; and you have the courage to assert, as
within my knowledge, that by the election of Horace
Greeley “Congress is handed over to the control of the
party who have persistently denied the rights of the
black man.” You say that I know this. Mr. Speaker,
I know no such thing, and you should be sufficiently
thoughtful not to assert it. I am entirely satisfied
that a canvass like the present, where the principles
declared at Cincinnati are openly accepted on one side
and not contested on the other, must result in a larger
number of Congressional Representatives sincerely
devoted to the rights of the colored citizen than ever
before.</p>

<p>The Democrats will be pledged, as never before, to
the ruling principle that All Men are Equal before the
Law, and also to the three Constitutional Amendments,
with the clause in each empowering Congress to enforce
the same by appropriate legislation. But besides
Democrats, there will be Liberal Republicans pledged
likewise, and also your peculiar associates, who, I trust,
will not betray the cause. Senators and Representatives
calling themselves Republicans have been latterly
in large majority in both Houses; but the final measure
of Civil Rights, to which you refer, though urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
by me almost daily, has failed to become a law, less,
I fear, from Democratic opposition than from Republican
lukewarmness and the want of support in the
President.</p>

<p>The great issue which the people are called to decide
in November is on the President, and nobody knows
better than yourself that the House of Representatives,
chosen at the same time, will naturally harmonize with
him. So it has been in our history. Now harmony
with Horace Greeley involves what I most desire. With
such a President, Congress will be changed. For the
first time since the war the Equal Rights of All will
have a declared representative at the head of the Government,
whose presence there will be of higher significance
than that of any victor in war, being not only
a testimony, but a constant motive-power in this great
cause.</p>

<p>Opposition, whether open hostility or more subtle
treachery, will yield to the steady influence of such a
representative. Therefore in looking to the President I
look also to Congress, which will take its character in
large measure from him. In choosing Horace Greeley
we do the best we can for the whole Government,&mdash;not
only in the Executive, but in the Legislative branch,&mdash;while
we decline to support nepotism, repayment of
personal gifts by official patronage, seizure of the war
powers, indignity to the Black Republic,&mdash;also, the various
incapacity exhibited by the President, and the
rings by which he governs,&mdash;none of which can you
defend. You know well that the rings are already condemned
by the American people.</p>

<p>For myself, I say plainly and without hesitation, that
I prefer Horace Greeley, with any Congress possible on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the Cincinnati Platform, to President Grant, <i>with his
personal government and his rings</i>,&mdash;a vote for whom
involves the support of this personal government, <i>with
prolonged power in all the rings</i>. There must be another
influence and another example. The Administration,
in all its parts, is impressed by the President.
Let his soul be enlarged with the sentiment of justice,
quickened by industry, and not only the two Houses of
Congress, but the whole country, will feel the irresistible
authority, overspreading, pervading, permeating everywhere.
Therefore, in proportion as you are earnest for
the rights of the colored citizen, and place them above
all partisan triumph, you will be glad to support the
candidate whose heart has always throbbed for Humanity.
The country needs such a motive-power in the
White House; it needs a generous fountain there. In
one word, it needs somebody different from the present
incumbent; and nobody knows this better than Speaker
Blaine.</p>

<p>The personal imputation you make upon me I repel
with the indignation of an honest man. I was a faithful
supporter of the President until somewhat tardily
awakened by his painful conduct on the island of San
Domingo, involving seizure of the war power in violation
of the Constitution, and indignity to the Black
Republic in violation of International Law; and when
I remonstrated against these intolerable outrages, I was
set upon by those acting in his behalf. Such is the origin
of my opposition. I could not have done less without
failure in that duty which is with me the rule of
life. Nor can I doubt that when partisan sentiments
are less active you will regret the wrong you have done
me. Meanwhile I appeal confidently to the candid judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of those who, amidst all present differences of opinion,
unite in the great objects, far above Party or President,
to which my life is devoted.</p>

<p class="sig">I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p>The serenade was given under the auspices of the colored men of the

the crowd in attendance is reported to have been “one of the largest

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Friends and Fellow-Citizens</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">I am touched by this voluntary expression of friendship,
and beg to thank you from the heart.</p>

<p>In seeing you on this occasion I think of you only as
personal friends among whom I have lived more than
twenty years. During this considerable period changes
have occurred of incalculable importance to the country,
but especially to the colored people. When I entered
upon my public duties here Slavery was in the ascendant,
giving the law to all the usages of life. The colored
man was degraded. He was not allowed to testify in
court; he was shut out from the public schools; he was
excluded from the public conveyances, and thrust away
from the ballot-box. But here in the National Capital
all these terrible wrongs have ceased. The court-room,
the school-house, the horse-car, and the ballot-box are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
all open, never to be closed. Revolutions do not go
backward. Therefore you may rest secure in what has
been won. Of this be sure, Slavery will never be revived,
nor will you be restrained or limited in any of
these rights you now enjoy. [<i>Applause, and three cheers
for Mr. Sumner.</i>]</p>

<p>Most sincerely do I congratulate you on these signal
triumphs, so little to be expected when I first became
acquainted with you. And when we consider the brief
period in which they have been accomplished, I am sure
you will unite with me in hope and trust for the future.
[<i>Cries, “We will!”</i>]</p>

<p>It is my duty, however, to remind you that the work is
not yet completed. This will be only by the enactment
of a Civil Rights Bill which shall relieve the citizen,
whoever he may be, from any exclusion or discrimination
on account of his color. Only then will be established
that Equality before the Law to which now, for the first
time in our history, all political parties are distinctly
pledged. Here there can be no question. [<i>Applause.</i>]
It is in the platforms of all. Of the early passage of
such a law I do not doubt. Then will you have all the
assurance of your rights that can be found in the Constitution
and law. But that law will be the cap-stone.
[<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>I shall not disguise from you that something more
will be needed. There must be a constant, watchful,
public opinion behind, to see that these are enforced
in letter and spirit. Here there must be no failure in
awakening and invigorating this public opinion. You
can do much,&mdash;I would almost say you can do everything.
How constantly have I urged, in public speech
and in all my intercourse with you, that our colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
fellow-citizens must insist upon their rights always, by
petition, by speech, and by vote! Above all, never vote
for any man who is not true to you. Make allegiance
to you the measure of your support. [<i>Cheers.</i>] So
doing, all parties will seek your vote. [<i>Cheers.</i>] You
will be felt, and your cause will be irresistible.</p>

<p>Please accept these few words as my acknowledgment
of your kindness this evening. [<i>Cries, “Go on!”</i>] From
long acquaintance you know something of my sympathies.
[<i>A voice, “I do!”</i>] Always from the beginning
I have sought to serve you, and always to the end shall
I seek to serve you. To your cause my life is dedicated,
and nothing can turn me from it, nothing can tempt me
or drive me from its support. [<i>Loud applause.</i>]</p>

GRANT.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Letter to Hon. Andrew D. White, President of Cornell
University, August 10, 1872.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, August 10, 1872.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I am surprised by a statement
purporting to proceed from you, which I find under
the telegraphic head, to the effect that I have misrepresented
facts with regard to Frederick Douglass.</p>

<p>In making this allegation you defend the Commissioners
to San Domingo, and allege that Mr. Douglass
was well treated by them. I have never said the contrary,
nor have I ever alluded to the treatment he received
from them. Not a word or hint can be found on
the subject in anything written or spoken by me.</p>

<p>My allusion was to the exclusion of Mr. Douglass
from the common table of the mail-packet on the Potomac,
almost within sight of the Executive Mansion,
simply on account of color,&mdash;and I added, that the President,
on whose invitation he had joined the Commission,
never uttered a word in rebuke of this exclusion, and
when entertaining the returned Commissioners at dinner
carefully omitted Mr. Douglass, who was in Washington
at the time, and thus repeated the indignity. On this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
you are represented as remarking, that General Sigel
was also omitted, but that, in fact, Mr. Douglass and
General Sigel had already left for their homes (forgetting
that Mr. Douglass continued in Washington); and
you do not allow yourself to doubt, that, had they been
in town, they would have been included in the invitation.
Your apology clearly shows your opinion that
they ought to have been invited; but please not to forget
that there was a reason for inviting Mr. Douglass
that did not exist in the case of General Sigel. The
General was white, and he had suffered no indignity on
board a mail-packet which it was in the power of the
President to rebuke by example.</p>

<p>But you are mistaken in the facts, as appears by the
newspapers of the time. The Commissioners reached
Washington on the evening of March 27th. They were
entertained at dinner by the President March 30th. On
the day before the dinner Mr. Douglass presided at the
Convention to nominate a Delegate to Congress from
the District of Columbia, and on taking the chair made
a speech. Mr. Chipman was nominated against Mr.
Douglass, who made another speech thanking his supporters
for their votes. To gratify the friends of Mr.
Douglass, there was an understanding that he should
succeed Mr. Chipman as Secretary of the District.
These things show that Mr. Douglass was not only in
Washington, but conspicuously so, presiding at a public
Convention, and being voted for as a candidate for
Congress.</p>

<p>But we are not left to inference. Mr. A. M. Green,
of Washington, who at the Convention nominated Mr.
Douglass for Congress, assures us that he did not leave
town till some days later. Mr. Green further states, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
a note dated August 10th, now before me, that about
this time he and another friend called on Mr. Douglass,
in relation to his appointment by the President as Secretary
of the District; that Mr. Douglass, while thanking
them for their earnestness in his behalf, assured them
that he had no hope of success; that he had “new evidence
of the conservative character or tendency of the
Administration, which warranted him in the opinion that
we could not succeed”; and Mr. Green says that Mr.
Douglass added these words: “I was not only neglected
without any rebuke for the offence from the President,
but the Commissioners have been invited to dine with
the President, and the same spirit of neglect has been
exhibited in that respect also.” Mr. Green adds, that
recently, while on the way to the National Colored Convention
at New Orleans, Mr. Douglass, in conversation
with Mr. Downing and himself, “referred in a complaining
spirit to this circumstance.”</p>

<p>I have also before me a note, dated August 10th,
from Mr. Wormley, so well known for his excellent
hotel in Washington, who says that he asked Mr. Douglass,
shortly after his return, if he dined with the President
and the Commissioners, to which he answered,
“No, and for the good reason that I was not invited”;
and then he added, “It is no use to deny it, but I feel it
sorely.” This was at Mr. Douglass’s office. On another
occasion, at his son’s house, referring to the same thing,
he said to Mr. Wormley, “I felt it keenly.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gray, recently of the Legislative Council of the
District, nominated by the President and confirmed by
the Senate, now a School Trustee, assures me that Mr.
Douglass spoke to him of his omission by the President
with the same feeling that he exhibited to Mr. Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and Mr. Wormley. These witnesses are all colored, but
even without the new law nobody would question their
testimony. I add my own acquaintance with the case.
At my house, Mr. Douglass, while speaking not unkindly,
said that he felt the President’s neglect in not inviting
him to dine, which was more noticeable, as he had gone
to San Domingo at the express invitation of the President,
and on his return was insulted on board the Potomac
mail-packet. He added, that an invitation from
the President would have been a proper rebuke to those
who had insulted him.</p>

<p>I will add, that it is a matter of common notoriety
that Mr. Douglass did not disguise his feelings on account
of this Presidential incident.</p>

<p>Such are the facts and the evidence. I think that
you will see, my dear Sir, that, if there is any misstatement,
or, as you express it, “perversion of facts,” it is
not on my part.</p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;It is on the invitation of
the State Committee of Liberal Republicans that
I have the honor of addressing you. I shall speak directly
on the issue before us. If I am frank and plain,
it will be only according to my nature and the requirement
of duty at this time. But nothing can I say
which is not prompted by a sincere desire to serve my
country, and especially to promote that era of good-will,
when the assent of all shall be assured to the equal
rights of all.</p>

<h4>THE TWO CANDIDATES.</h4>

<p>At the approaching Presidential Election the people
are to choose between two candidates. By the operation
of our electoral system, and the superadded dictation
of National Conventions, the choice is practically
limited to President Grant and Horace Greeley; so that
no preference for another can be made effective. One
of these must be taken. Preferring Horace Greeley, I
have no hesitation in assigning the reasons which lead
me to this conclusion.</p>

<p>Believing the present incumbent unfit for the great
office to which he aspires for a second time, and not
doubting that a vote for him would be regarded as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
sanction of abuses and pretensions unrepublican in character,
I early saw the difficulty of taking any part for
his reëlection. Long ago I declared, that, while recognizing
party as an essential agency and convenience, I
could not allow it to constrain my conscience against
what seemed the requirements of public good. Regarding
always substance rather than form, I have been indifferent
to the name by which I might be called. Nor
was I impressed by the way in which the candidate was
urged. Supporters, while admitting his failure, and
even the abuses and pretensions so notorious in his
civil life, commended his reëlection as necessary to uphold
the party with which I have been associated. But
it is easy to see that a vote for such a candidate on such
a reason was “to do evil that good might come,” which
is forbidden in politics as in morals.</p>

<p>Two courses seemed open. One was to abstain from
voting,&mdash;and I confess that this was my first inclination.
But it is not easy for me to be neutral,&mdash;certainly
where wrong-doing is in question; nor is it my habit to
shrink from responsibility. But the doubt that beset
me was removed when I saw the Democratic Party
adopt the candidate opposed to President Grant, being
an original Republican already nominated by a Republican
Convention, and at the same time accept the Republican
platform on which he was nominated. An old
party, which had long stood out against the Republican
cause, now placed itself on a Republican platform, the
best ever adopted, with a Republican candidate, who
was the most devoted Republican ever nominated,&mdash;thus
completely accepting the results of the war, and
offering the hand of reconciliation. At once the character
of the contest changed. This was no common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
event. Pardon me, if I say that to me it was of peculiar
interest. For years I have sought to establish in the
National Government the great principles of the Declaration
of Independence, avowing always that when
this was done nobody should surpass me in generosity
towards former Rebels. Not only by the logic of my
life, but by constant speeches, was I bound to welcome
those who placed themselves on this glorious platform.
The extent of this obligation will appear before I close.
And now its performance harmonizes with opposition to
the prolonged misrule of the present incumbent.</p>

<h4>TWO REASONS IN FAVOR OF GREELEY.</h4>

<p>Evidently I am not at liberty to abstain from voting.
In considering the reasons in favor of Horace Greeley, I
find two, differing in character, but of chief importance:
first, that he represents a reformed civil service, beginning
with the One-Term principle, without which this
reform is too much like a sham; and, secondly, that he
represents reconciliation, not only between the two sections,
but between the two races, which is essential to
the repose of the country and the safeguard of Equal
Rights.</p>

<p>To these must be added, that he does not represent
those personal pretensions, so utterly inconsistent with
Republican government, which are now known as Grantism.
In voting for Horace Greeley you will not sustain
nepotism, you will not sustain gift-taking and repayment
by official favor, and you will not lend your sanction
to the San Domingo machination, with its unconstitutional
usurpations, its violations of International
Law, and its indignity to the Black Republic. Elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
I have considered these fully,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and I am not aware
of any answer to the undeniable facts. I shall only
glance at them now.</p>

<h4>NEPOTISM.</h4>

<p>Nepotism is already condemned by history, and most
justly; for it is obviously a form of self-seeking, hostile
to purity of government, and strangely out of place in a
Republic. Nothing for self, but all for country and
mankind, should be the rule of our President. If the
promptings of his inner nature fail, then must he feel
the irresistible obligation of his position. As he does,
so will others do; and therefore must his example be
such as to elevate the public service. Nothing in Washington’s
career has shone with more constant light than
his refusal to confer office on his relations. Even at the
time, it arrested attention not only at home but abroad,
landing praise in England. Of this there is a striking
illustration. The “Register of the Times,” published at
London in 1795, in an article entitled “Interesting and
Authentic Documents respecting the United States of
America,” records its homage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The execution of the office of the Chief Magistrate has
been attended through a term of four years with a circumstance
which to an admiring world requires no commentary.
A native citizen of the United States, transferred from private
life to that station, has not, during so long a term, appointed
a single relation to any office of honor or emolument.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

</div>

<p>With such confession an admiring world looked on.
Something would I do&mdash;something, I trust, the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
people will do at the coming election&mdash;to secure
this beautiful praise yet again for our country.</p>

<h4>GIFT-TAKING.</h4>

<p>Like nepotism, the taking of gifts by a public servant
is condemned by history. No honest nature can uphold
it. How well did our late General Thomas, so admirable
in character, rebuke this abuse, when he replied
to an offer of $100,000, as I am told, “Let it go to
my men”! If not a form of bribery, it is kindred in
nature,&mdash;and this has long been recognized, from the
Bible down to our day. According to the old scriptures
it is destructive: “The king by judgment stablisheth the
land; but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Here
again is the example of Washington brightly lighting
the true republican pathway. The same President who
would not appoint a relation would not take a gift, even
when out of office. His example was in harmony with
the lesson of Colonial days. As long ago as April 20,
1703, Queen Anne, in a communication to Lord Cornbury,
Governor of New York and New Jersey, laid down
the following rule: that neither the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor,
Commander-in-Chief, or President of the
Council “do receive any gift or present from the Assembly
<i>or others</i> on any account or in any manner whatsoever,
upon pain of our highest displeasure, and of being
recalled from that our Government.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> This rule is
as good for our day as for that in which it was ordained
by royal authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>There is another instance, which should not be forgotten.
It is that of Lord Wellesley, the accomplished
brother of the Duke of Wellington. A work so common
as that of Smiles on “Self-Help” records, that, while
Governor-General of India, he positively refused a present
of £100,000 from the Directors of the East India
Company on the conquest of Mysore; and here the
terms of his refusal are important:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not necessary for me to allude to the independence of
my character and the proper dignity attaching to my office;
other reasons besides these important considerations lead me
to decline this testimony, which is not suitable to me. I
think of nothing but our army. I should be much distressed
to curtail the share of those brave soldiers.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

</div>

<p>His refusal remained unalterable. At a later period,
when nearly eighty years of age, embarrassed by debts,
and entirely withdrawn from public life, he allowed the
Company to vote him a much smaller sum in consideration
of his signal services.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<h4>GIFT-MAKERS APPOINTED TO OFFICE.</h4>

<p>The allowances voted by Parliament to Marlborough
and Wellington on account of their victories can be no
precedent for the acceptance of gifts from fellow-citizens.
The distinction is clear. But the case against the present
incumbent is not only that while holding high office he
accepted gifts from fellow-citizens, but subsequently appointed
the gift-makers to office,&mdash;thus using the Presidency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
to pay off his own personal obligations. Please
bear this in mind; and when some apologist attempts to
defend the taking of gifts, let him know that he must
go still further, and show that the Presidency, with all
its patronage, is a perquisite to be employed for the private
advantage of the incumbent.</p>

<h4>SAN DOMINGO.</h4>

<p>Next in illustration of the prevailing misrule is the
San Domingo business, with its eccentricities of wrong-doing;
and this, too, is now in issue. At the thought
of this unprecedented enormity, where wrong assumes
such various forms, it is hard to be silent; but I shall be
brief. The case is clear, and stands on documents which
cannot be questioned. I keep within the line of moderate
statement, when I say, that, from the beginning of
our Government, nothing in our foreign relations has
been so absolutely indefensible. It will not do to call it
simply a fault and an insolence; it was an elaborate
contrivance, conceived in lust of territory, pursued in
ignorance, maintained in open violation of the National
Constitution, pushed forward in similar violation of International
Law in fundamental principles, and crowned
by intolerable indignity to the Black Republic, even to
the extent of menacing hostilities and the sinking of its
ships,&mdash;all without authority of Congress, and by Presidential
prerogative alone. In this drama the President,
like a favorite actor, assumed every part. In negotiating
the treaty he was President; in declaring war he was
Congress; in sending ships and men he was Commander-in-Chief;
and then in employing private influence with
Senators to promote his scheme&mdash;according to the promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
in the protocol with Baez, signed in his name by Orville
E. Babcock, entitled therein “Aide-de-Camp to his
Excellency General Ulysses S. Grant, President of the
United States of America”&mdash;he was lobbyist. That
such things can be done by a President without indignant
condemnation, loud and universal, shows a painful
demoralization in the country. That their author can be
presented for reëlection to the Presidency, whose powers
he has thus misused, shows a disheartening insensibility
to public virtue.</p>

<p>Here I remark, that, so long as the President confined
himself to negotiation, he was strictly within the line of
the Constitution. Even if indiscreet in character and
impolitic in object, it was not unconstitutional. But in
seizing war powers without the authority of Congress,
in upholding the usurper Baez that he might sell his
country, in menacing the Black Republic, and then in
playing the lobbyist to promote the contrivance, the President
did what no other President ever did before, and
what, for the sake of Republican Institutions, should be
rebuked by the American people. It was the knowledge
of these proceedings that changed essentially my relations
to the question.</p>

<h4>PERSONAL MISREPRESENTATIONS.</h4>

<p>I allude with hesitation to personal misrepresentations
on the matter. It has been said that I promised
originally to support the treaty. This is a mistake. I
knew nothing of the treaty, and had no suspicion of it,
until several months after the protocol, and some time
after the negotiation was completed; and then my simple
promise was that it should have from me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> “the most
careful and candid consideration”; and such I gave it
most sincerely. At first my opposition was reserved and
without allusion to the President. It was only when
the strange business was fully disclosed in official documents
communicated in confidence to the Senate, and it
was still pressed, that I felt impelled to a sterner resistance.
Especially was I constrained, when I found how
much the people of Hayti suffered. It so happened that
I had reported the bill acknowledging their independence
and establishing diplomatic relations between our
two countries, assuring that equality which had been
violated. Not unmoved could I witness the wrong inflicted
upon them. And has it come to this, that the
President of the Great Republic, instead of carrying
peace and good tidings to Africans commencing the
experiment of self-government, should become to them
an agent of terror?</p>

<p>It is difficult to see how I could have done otherwise.
Anxious to excuse the anger towards me, it has been
said that I opposed the treaty because Mr. Motley was
unceremoniously removed from the mission at London;
and here you will see the extent to which misrepresentation
has gone. It so happens that Mr. Motley was removed
on the day immediately following the rejection
of the treaty. Evidently my opposition was not influenced
by the removal: was the removal influenced by
my opposition?</p>

<p>Equally absurd is the story that I am now influenced
by personal feelings. I am a public servant, trained to
duty; and now, as always before, I have yielded only to
this irresistible mandate. With me there is no alternative.
The misconduct of the President, so apparent
in the San Domingo device, became more conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
in the light of illustrative facts, showing it to be part of
a prevailing misrule, which, for the sake of our country,
should not be prolonged. As a patriot citizen, anxious
for the national welfare and renown, am I obliged to
declare these convictions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am now brought to those two chief measures to be
advanced by the election of Horace Greeley, each of controlling
importance,&mdash;one looking directly to purity and
efficiency in the government, and the other to the peace
and welfare of our country.</p>

<h4>ONE-TERM PRINCIPLE.</h4>

<p>The principle of One Term for President is the corner-stone
of a reformed civil service. So plain is this
to my apprehension, that I am at a loss to understand
how any one sincerely in favor of such reform can fail
to insist upon this principle. All experience shows that
the employment of the appointing power to promote the
personal ends of the President is the great disturbing
influence in our civil service. Here is the comprehensive
abuse which envelops all the offices of the country,
making them tributary to one man, and subordinate to
his desires. Let this be changed, and you have the first
stage of reform, without which all other measures are
dilatory, if not feeble and inefficient. How futile to
recommend, as is done by the Commissioners on Civil
Service, “an honest competitive examination,” while the
rules for this system are left to the discretion of a President
seeking reëlection! “Lead us not into temptation”
is part of the brief prayer we are all taught to
repeat; nor are Presidents above the necessity of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
prayer. The misuse of the appointing power to advance
ambitious aims is a temptation to which a President
must not be exposed. For his sake, and for the sake
of the country, this must not be.</p>

<p>In attributing peril to this influence, I speak not
only from my own careful observation, but from the
testimony of others whose words are authoritative. You
do not forget how Andrew Jackson declared that the
limitation of the office to one term was required, in order
to place the President “beyond the reach of any
improper influences” and “uncommitted to any other
course than the strict line of constitutional duty,”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>&mdash;how
William Henry Harrison announced, that, with the
adoption of this principle, “the incumbent would devote
all his time to the public interest, and there would be
no cause to misrule the country,”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>&mdash;how Henry Clay
was satisfied, after much observation and reflection, “that
too much of the time, the thoughts, and the exertions of
the incumbent are occupied during his first term in securing
his reëlection,”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>&mdash;and how my senatorial associate
of many years, Benjamin F. Wade, after denouncing
the reëligibility of the President, said, “There are defects
in the Constitution, and this is among the most glaring.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
According to this experienced Senator, the reëligibility
of the President is not only a defect in the Constitution,
but one of its most glaring defects.</p>

<p>And such also was the declared opinion of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
incumbent before his election and the temptation
of a second term. It has been stated by one who conferred
with him at the time, that immediately before his
nomination General Grant said, in the spirit of Andrew
Jackson, “The liberties of the country cannot be maintained
without a One-Term Amendment of the Constitution”;
and another writes me, that while on a walk
between the White House and the Treasury, just at the
head of the steps, near the fountain, the General paused
a moment, and said, “I am in favor of restricting the
President to a single term, and of abolishing the office of
Vice-President.” By the authority of this declaration,
the “Morning Chronicle,”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> the organ of the Republican
party at Washington, proclaimed of its Presidential candidate,
“He is, moreover, an advocate of the One-Term
principle, as conducing toward the proper administration
of the law”; and then at a later date,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> after calling
for the adoption of this principle, the same Republican
organ said, “General Grant is in favor of it.” Unquestionably
at that time, while the canvass was proceeding,
he allowed himself to be commended as a supporter of
this principle. That he should now disregard it gives new
reason for the prayer, “Lead us not into temptation.”</p>

<p>Never before was the necessity for this beneficent
Amendment more apparent; for never before was the
wide-spread abuse from the reëligibility of the President
more grievously conspicuous. De Tocqueville, the illustrious
Frenchman, who saw our institutions with a vision
quickened by genius and chastened by friendly regard,
discerned the peril, when he said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Intrigue and corruption are the natural vices of elective
government; but when the head of the State can be reëlected,
these evils rise to a great height and compromise the very existence
of the country. When a simple candidate seeks to
rise by intrigue, his manœuvres must be limited to a very
narrow sphere; <i>but when the Chief Magistrate enters the lists,
he borrows the strength of the Government for his own purposes</i>.…
If the representative of the Executive descends into
the combat, the cares of Government dwindle for him into
second-rate importance, and the success of his election is his
first concern.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nothing can be more true than these remarkable words,
which are completely verified in what we now behold.
The whole diversified machinery of the National Government
in all its parts, operating in State, District, Town,
and Village, is now at work to secure the reëlection of
the President, as for some time before it worked to
secure his renomination,&mdash;the whole being obedient to
the central touch.</p>

<p>Look for a moment at this machinery, or, if you
please, at this political hierarchy, beginning with Cabinet
officers, and reaching to the pettiest postmaster, every one
diligent to the single end of serving Presidential aspiration.
The Jeffersonian rule was, “Is he honest? Is he
capable? Is he faithful to the Constitution?” But this
is now lost in the mightier law, “Is he faithful to reëlection?”
This failing, all merit fails. Every office-holder,
from highest to lowest, according to his influence, becomes
propagandist, fugleman, whipper-in. Members
of the Cabinet set the example, and perambulate the
country, instructing the people to vote for reëlection.
Heads of Bureaus do likewise. Then, in their respective
localities, officers of the Customs, officers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Internal Revenue, marshals with their deputies, and
postmasters, each and all, inspired from the National
Capitol, are all calling for reëlection. This organized
power, variously estimated at from sixty to eighty thousand
in number, all paid by the Government, and overspreading
the whole country in one minute network, has
unprecedented control at this moment, partly from increased
facilities of communication, and partly from the
military drill which still survives the war, but more,
perhaps, from the determined will of the President, to
which all these multitudinous wills are subjugated. This
simple picture, which nobody can question, reveals a
tyranny second only to that of the Slave Power itself,&mdash;which
Jefferson seems to have foreseen, when, after portraying
the Legislature as most to be feared in his day,
he said, “The tyranny of the Executive will come in its
turn.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Even his prophetic vision did not enable him to
foresee the mournful condition we now deplore, with the
One-Man Power lording itself through all the offices of
the country.</p>

<p>The recent election in North Carolina made this practically
manifest. Even without a telescope, all could
discern the operations of the field. Postmasters and
officers of Internal Revenue were on hand, each in his
place; then came the Marshal, with files of deputies,
extemporized for the occasion; while, ranging over the
extensive circuit, was the Supervisor of the Revenue;
the whole instructed and animated by members of the
Cabinet, who abandoned their responsible duties to help
reëlection, which for the time was above all departments
of Government and all exigencies of the public service.
In the same way the chief Custom-Houses of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
have been enlisted. Each has become a political centre
whose special object is reëlection. Authentic evidence
before a Congressional Committee shows that
Thomas Murphy, while Collector of New York, acting
as Lieutenant of the President, sought to control the
Republican State Convention by tendering office to four
men, in consideration of the return of certain delegates,
promising that “he would immediately send their names
on to Washington and have them appointed”; and by
way of enforcing the Presidential supremacy, he announced
with startling effrontery that “President Grant
was the representative and head of the Republican party,
and all good Republicans should support him in all his
measures and appointments, and any one who did not do
it should be <i>crushed out</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> If this were not authenticated
under oath, it would be hard to believe. But the
New Orleans Custom-House has a story much worse.
Here Presidential pretension is mixed with unblushing
corruption, in which the Collector, a brother-in-law, is a
chief actor. And all for reëlection.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>This prostitution of the offices of the country to the
Presidential will can be upheld only by unhesitating
partisan zeal, discarding reason and patriotism. Already
it has been condemned in an official Report made to the
House of Representatives, November 25, 1867, by Mr.
Boutwell, as Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary,
and signed by him. His direct object was to
arraign Andrew Johnson; but these words declare a rule
applicable to all Presidents:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The presence and active participation of <i>two of the
Heads of Departments</i> in a political convention at Philadelphia,
having for its object the organization of a party to
sustain the policy of the President and defeat the will of
Congress and the people, and one of those functionaries
the prime agent in the removals from and appointments to
office for ‘political reasons,’ is a fact well known to the country.
The like had not happened before in its history. In
the view of right-minded men, it was something more than
a public scandal.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Report adduces the authority of John Locke, the
eminent philosopher, as declaring “the employment of
‘the force, treasure, and <i>offices of the society to corrupt the
representatives, or openly to preëngage the electors, and prescribe
what manner of persons shall be chosen</i>,’ as among
those breaches of trust in the executive magistrate which
amounts to a dissolution of the Government; for ‘what
is it,’ he says, ‘but to cut up the Government by the
roots, and poison the very fountains of public security?’”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
But all this we witness here. The offices are
employed to preëngage the electors, and prescribe the
persons to be chosen. Nor do I see any corrective of
this undoubted abuse, especially after the example now
set in high quarters, so long as the President is a candidate
for reëlection.</p>

<p>Therefore, to arrest a flagrant tyranny, and to secure
purity in the Government, also to save the President
from himself, should this Amendment be adopted; and
since Horace Greeley is known to be its strenuous supporter,
we have an unanswerable reason in his behalf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<h4>RECONCILIATION.</h4>

<p>From the practical question of Civil Service Reform
I pass to Reconciliation, being the most important issue
ever presented to the American people,&mdash;reconciliation
not only between the two once warring sections, but also
between the two races. This issue, so grand and beautiful,
was distinctly presented, when Horace Greeley, in accepting
the Republican nomination at Cincinnati, wrote
these memorable words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this faith, and with the distinct understanding, that,
if elected, I shall be the President, not of a party, but of the
whole people, I accept your nomination,&mdash;in the confident
trust that the masses of our countrymen, North and South,
are eager to clasp hands across the bloody chasm which has
too long divided them, forgetting that they have been enemies,
in the joyful consciousness that they are, and must
henceforth remain, brethren.”<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The issue was again presented, when thereafter the
Democratic Party in National Convention, acting under
an irresistible movement of the people, nominated the
author of these words.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see how this noble aspiration can find
other than a generous response. Nothing but a party
spirit which forgets the obligations of Christian duty
could treat it with indifference, much less make it the
occasion of misrepresentation. By no effort of ingenuity
or malignity can it be tortured into anything but an
offer of reconciliation, while the very letter of acceptance,
where it appears, declares the established supremacy
of Equal Rights. Observe also that it is made only
when the work of Reconstruction is ended. Here is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
testimony of a Senator of South Carolina, in a speech in
the Senate, January 22, 1872:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The last of the Southern States is admitted to its full
privileges as a member of the brotherhood of States; the
Constitutional Amendments intended to secure the principles
established by the war and subsequent events have been
accepted as valid. There can be no fear or danger of their
being disturbed.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But these things are forgotten; the Sermon on the
Mount is forgotten also; the Beatitudes are put aside.
A great writer of the Middle Ages, after dwelling on
what is best for us, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hence it is that not riches, not pleasures, not honors, not
length of life, not health, not strength, not comeliness, was
sung to the shepherds from on high, but peace.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The supporters of reëlection will not hearken to this
song, and the proffered hand is rejected. If not war,
they would preserve at least the passions of war, and
instead of peace would scatter distrust and defiance.
The old fable is renewed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Emboldened now on fresh attempt he goes,</div>
<div class="verse">With serpent’s teeth the fertile furrows sows;</div>
<div class="verse">The glebe fermenting with enchanted juice</div>
<div class="verse">Makes the snake’s teeth a human crop produce.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For me there can be but one course on this issue, and
the moment it was presented I seemed to behold, for
the first time, the dawn of that better era in our country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
when the Equal Rights of All should be placed under
the safeguard of assured Peace and Reconciliation. Had
I failed to sympathize with this endeavor, I should have
been false to the record of my life. My first public utterance,
as far back as July 4, 1845, was to commend
the cause of Peace, which from that early day, amidst
the contentions of public duty and the terrible responsibilities
of war, has never been absent from my mind.
While insisting on the Abolition of Slavery, while urging
Enfranchisement, while vindicating the Equal Rights
of All, and while pressing Reconstruction, I have constantly
declared that all these were for no purpose of
vengeance or punishment, but only for the security of
the citizen and the establishment of government on
just foundations, and that when this was done nobody
should outdo me in those generosities that become the
conqueror more than his conquest.</p>

<h4>PERSONAL RECORD.</h4>

<p>Here the testimony is complete. If I open it now, it
is less to show the obligations which constrain me personally
than to make these witnesses plead again the cause
which from the beginning I have had at heart. I follow
the order of time, letting each speak in a few words.</p>

<p>There are some among us who may remember that
early speech before the Republican State Convention at
Worcester, October 1, 1861, which excited at the time
so much discussion, when, after calling for Emancipation,
I united this cause with Peace:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Two objects are before us, <i>Union and Peace</i>, each for the
sake of the other, and both for the sake of the country; but
without Emancipation how can we expect either?”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus at the beginning was I mindful of Peace.</p>

<p>Then again, in the same strain, at the Cooper Institute,
New York, November 27, 1861, after showing Slavery to
be the origin and main-spring of the Rebellion, I pleaded
for Emancipation, and at the same time first sounded the
key-note of Reconciliation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Perversely and pitifully do you postpone that sure period
of <i>reconciliation, not only between the two sections, not only between
the men of the North and the men of the South, but, more
necessary still, between slave and master</i>, without which the true
tranquillity we all seek cannot be permanently assured. Believe
it, <i>only through such reconciliation</i>, under sanction of freedom,
can you remove all occasions of conflict hereafter.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus early was reconciliation associated with my most
earnest efforts; nor did I at any moment hesitate in this
work.</p>

<p>The same spirit was manifest in opposition to perpetuating
the memory of victories over fellow-citizens.
The question arose on a dispatch of General McClellan,
where, after announcing the capture of Williamsburg,
he inquired whether he was “authorized to follow the
example of other generals, and direct the names of battles
to be placed on the colors of regiments.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> This being
communicated to the Senate, I felt it my duty to
move, May 8, 1862, the following resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That in the efforts now making for <i>the restoration
of the Union and the establishment of peace throughout the
country</i>, it is inexpedient that the names of victories obtained
over our fellow-citizens should be placed on the regimental
colors of the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again was anxiety for peace. Mr. Wilson, my
colleague, did not agree with me, and he made haste to
introduce a counter-resolution;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> but no further action
was had upon it. The usage of civilized nations is
against placing on regimental colors the names of victories
gained over fellow-countrymen. In France, the
most military country of the world, the principle was
carefully discarded by King Louis Philippe, when, in
preparing the Museum at Versailles, he excluded every
picture or image of civil war. Everything to arouse and
gratify the patriotic pride of Frenchmen, of all Frenchmen,
is there, but nothing to exhibit Frenchmen warring
with each other.</p>

<p>Then came the bills for Confiscation, which I supported
chiefly with a view to Emancipation. While
enforcing this object, May 19, 1862, I said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“People talk flippantly of the gallows as the certain doom
of the Rebels. This is a mistake. For weal or woe, the gallows
is out of the question. It is not possible as a punishment
for this rebellion.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then declaring our supreme object to be Peace, I said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In this work it is needless to say <i>there is no place for any
sentiment of hate or any suggestion of vengeance</i>. There can be
no exaction and no punishment beyond the necessity of the
case,&mdash;nothing harsh, nothing excessive. Lenity and pardon
become the conqueror more even than victory. ‘Do in time
of peace the most good, and in time of war the least evil possible:
such is the Law of Nations.’ These are the admirable
words of an eminent French magistrate and statesman. In
this spirit it is our duty to assuage the calamities of war, and
especially to spare an inoffensive population.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, June 27th, while the same subject
was under consideration, I returned to it again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But I confess frankly that I look with more hope and
confidence to Liberation than to Confiscation. To give freedom
is nobler than to take property, and on this occasion it
cannot fail to be more efficacious, for in this way the rear-guard
of the Rebellion will be changed into the advance-guard
of the Union. There is in Confiscation, unless when
directed against the criminal authors of the Rebellion, a harshness
inconsistent with that mercy which it is always a sacred
duty to cultivate, and which should be manifest in proportion
to our triumphs, ‘mightiest in the mightiest.’ <i>But Liberation
is not harsh; and it is certain, if properly conducted, to
carry with it the smiles of a benignant Providence.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At last the country was gladdened by the Proclamation
of Emancipation, which here in Faneuil Hall, October
6, 1862, I vindicated as a measure of peace; and
then I said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the old war between King and Parliament, which rent
England, the generous Falkland cried from his soul, <i>Peace!
Peace!</i>&mdash;and History gratefully records his words. Never
did he utter this cry with more earnestness than I do now.
But how shall the blessing be secured?”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

</div>

<p><i>By Emancipation</i>, was my answer.</p>

<p>Then came the bill creating the Freedmen’s Bureau.
In opening the debate on this interesting subject, June
8, 1864, I said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is for the Senate to determine, under the circumstances,
what it will do. My earnest hope is that it will do something.
The opportunity must not be lost of helping so many
persons now helpless, and <i>of aiding the cause of Reconciliation,
without which peace cannot be assured</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here again Reconciliation is announced as an ever-present
object.</p>

<p>In the same spirit, I deemed it my duty to oppose
the efforts made in the winter of 1865 to authorize Retaliation,
differing from valued friends. The proposition
for Retaliation was met by the following declaration,
moved by me, January 24th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The United States … call upon all to bear witness
that in this necessary warfare with Barbarism they renounce
all vengeance and every evil example, and plant
themselves firmly on the sacred landmarks of Christian
civilization, under the protection of that God who is present
with every prisoner, and enables heroic souls to suffer
for their country.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then came the effort, favored by President Lincoln,
to receive Louisiana with a Constitution which failed to
recognize the equal rights of colored fellow-citizens.
Here again, February 25th, I encountered the proposition
by a resolution, where it is declared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That such an oligarchical government is not competent at
this moment to discharge the duties and execute the powers
of a State; and that its recognition as a legitimate government
will tend to enfeeble the Union, <i>to postpone the day of Reconciliation</i>,
and to endanger the national tranquillity.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Mark, if you please, “<i>the day of Reconciliation</i>.”</p>

<p>Then came the question of perpetuating the memory
of our victories. February 27th, the Senate having under
consideration an appropriation for a picture in the
National Capitol, I moved as an amendment,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That in the National Capitol, dedicated to the National
Union, there shall be no picture of a victory in battle with
our own fellow-citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wilson again made haste to announce that he
“disagreed with his colleague altogether,”&mdash;saying, according
to the “Congressional Globe,”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> “I do not believe
in that doctrine.”</p>

<p>In the eulogy on President Lincoln, pronounced before
the municipal authorities of Boston, June 1, 1865,
the great object of Reconciliation was presented as dependent
on the establishment of our ideas. After insisting
upon Emancipation and the Equal Suffrage, these
words occur:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Such a vengeance will be a kiss of reconciliation, for it
will remove every obstacle to peace and harmony. The people
where Slavery once ruled will bless the blow that destroyed
it. The people where the kindred tyranny of Caste once prevailed
will rejoice that this fell under the same blow. They
will yet confess that it was dealt in no harshness, in no unkindness,
in no desire to humiliate, but simply and solemnly,
in the name of the Republic and of Human Nature, for their
good as well as ours,&mdash;ay, for their good more than ours.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
<p>“By ideas, more than by armies, we have conquered. The
sword of the Archangel was less mighty than the mission he
bore from the Lord. But if the ideas giving us the victory
are now neglected, if the pledges of the Declaration, which
the Rebellion openly assailed, are left unredeemed, then have
blood and treasure been lavished for nought.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then I proceeded to ask:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How shall these ideas be saved? How shall the war
waged by Abraham Lincoln be brought to an end, <i>so as to
assure peace, tranquillity, and reconciliation</i>?”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the speech at Worcester, before the Republican
State Convention, September 14, 1865, I insisted upon
guaranties for the national freedman and the national
creditor; and until these were accomplished, proposed
to exclude the Rebel from political power:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I ask not his punishment. I would not be harsh. There
is nothing humane that I would reject. Nothing in hate.
Nothing in vengeance. Nothing in passion. I am for gentleness.
I am for a velvet glove; but for a while I wish the
hand of iron. I confess that I have little sympathy with
those hypocrites of magnanimity whose appeal for the Rebel
master is only a barbarous indifference towards the slave; <i>and
yet they cannot more than I desire the day of Reconciliation</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus constantly did this idea return.</p>

<p>And yet again, in a letter to the “Evening Post” of
New York, dated September 28, 1865, after insisting
upon “supplementary safeguards” for the protection of
the freedman, I used these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Without this additional provision, I see small prospect
of <i>that peace and reconciliation which are the objects so near
our hearts</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Again it appeared in a telegraphic dispatch to President
Johnson, dated November 12, 1865, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
published. Asking the President to suspend his “policy
towards the Rebel States,” I said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I should not present this prayer, if I were not painfully
convinced that thus far it has failed to obtain any <i>reasonable
guaranties for that security in the future which is essential to
peace and reconciliation</i>.… The Declaration of Independence
asserts the equality of all men, and that rightful government
can be founded only on the consent of the governed.
I see small chance of peace, unless these great principles are
practically established. Without this, the house will continue
divided against itself.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here Reconciliation is associated with Reconstruction
on the basis of the Equality of All Men.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, in the “Atlantic Monthly” for December,
1865, p. 758, I pleaded again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The lesson of Clemency is of perpetual obligation.…
Harshness is bad. Cruelty is detestable. Even Justice may
relent at the prompting of Mercy. Fail not, then, to cultivate
the grace of Clemency.…</p>

<p>“There must be no vengeance upon enemies; but there
must be no sacrifice of friends. And here is the distinction
never to be forgotten: <i>Nothing for vengeance; everything for
justice</i>. Follow this rule, and the Republic will be safe and
glorious.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again in the Senate speech, February 5 and 6,
1866, while dwelling at length upon Equal Suffrage without
distinction of color, I thus spoke for the Southern
people:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The people there are my fellow-citizens, and gladly would
I hail them, if they would permit, as no longer <i>a section</i>, no
longer <i>the South</i>, but an integral part of the Republic, under
a Constitution which, knowing no North and no South, cannot
tolerate <i>sectional</i> pretension. Gladly, in all sincerity, do
I offer my best effort for their welfare. But I see clearly
that there is nothing in the compass of mortal power so important
to them in every respect, morally, politically, and economically&mdash;that
there is nothing with such certain promise
to them of beneficent result&mdash;that there is nothing so sure to
make their land smile with industry and fertility,&mdash;as the
decree of Equal Rights I now invoke.… This is our
retaliation. This is our only revenge.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In an address at the Music Hall, in Boston, October
2, 1866, entitled “The One-Man Power <i>vs.</i> Congress,”
I declared that the Reconstruction I sought was one
where “the Rebel region, no longer harassed by controversy
and degraded by injustice, <i>will enjoy the richest
fruits of security and reconciliation</i>,”&mdash;and then added,
“<i>To labor for this cause may well tempt the young and
rejoice the old</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Then, in the same address, I said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Our first duty is to provide safeguards for the future.
This can be only by provisions, sure, fundamental, and irrepealable,
fixing forever the results of the war, the obligations
of the Government, and the equal rights of all. Such is the
suggestion of common prudence and of self-defence, as well as
of common honesty. To this end we must make haste slowly.
States which precipitated themselves out of Congress must
not be permitted to precipitate themselves back. They must
not enter the Halls they treasonably deserted, until we have
every reasonable assurance of future good conduct. We must
not admit them, and then repent our folly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>.…</p>

<p>“But, while holding this ground of prudence, I desire to
disclaim every sentiment of vengeance or punishment, and also
every thought of delay or procrastination. Here I do not
yield to the President, or to any other person. Nobody more
anxious than I to see this chasm closed forever.</p>

<p>“<i>There is a long way and a short way. There is a long
time and a short time.</i> If there be any whose policy is for the
longest way or for the longest time, I am not of the number.
<i>I am for the shortest way, and also for the shortest time.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then in considering Reconstruction in the Senate,
March 16, 1867, I said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But I ask nothing in vengeance or unkindness. All that
I propose is for their good, with which is intertwined the
good of all. I would not impose any new penalty or bear
hard upon an erring people. Oh, no! I simply ask a new
safeguard for the future, that these States, through which so
much trouble has come, may be a strength and a blessing to
our common country, with prosperity and happiness everywhere
within their borders. I would not impose any new
burden; but I seek a new triumph for civilization. <i>For a
military occupation bristling with bayonets I would substitute
the smile of Peace.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>I then said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But this cannot be without Education. As the soldier
disappears, his place must be supplied by the schoolmaster.
The muster-roll will be exchanged for the school-register, and
our head-quarters will be in a school-house.”</p>

</div>

<p>And I accompanied this with a proposition to require
in the reconstructed States “a system of public schools
open to all, without distinction of race or color,” which
was lost by a tie vote, being 20 to 20.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject recurred again in the Senate July 13,
1867, when, after declaring regret at the inadequacy of
the pending measure, especially in not securing a system
of Public Education, and not excluding Rebel influence,
I remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In saying this, I desire to add, that, in my judgment, all
exclusions belong to what I call <i>the transition period</i>. When
Reconstruction is accomplished, the time will come for us to
open the gates.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In these few words will be found the ruling principle
which I have recognized in Reconstruction.</p>

<p>The address, “Are We a Nation?” made at the Cooper
Institute, November 19, 1867, testifies again to Reconciliation.
After showing how the national supremacy
in the guardianship of equal rights is consistent with
local self-government, and vindicating the two in their
respective spheres, it says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There will be a sphere alike for the States and Nation.
Local self-government, which is the pride of our institutions,
will be reconciled with the national supremacy in maintenance
of human rights, and the two together will constitute the elemental
principles of the Republic. The States will exercise
a minute jurisdiction required for the convenience of all; the
Nation will exercise that other paramount jurisdiction required
for the protection of all. <i>The reconciliation&mdash;God
bless the word!</i>&mdash;thus begun will embrace the people, who,
forgetting past differences, will feel more than ever that they
are one.”<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again, in addressing the Republican State Convention
at Worcester, September 22, 1869, I said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Do not think me harsh; do not think me austere. I am
not. I will not be outdone by anybody in clemency; nor at
the proper time will I be behind any one in opening all doors
of office and trust.… Who can object, if men recently arrayed
against their country are told to stand aside yet a little
longer, until all are secure in their rights? Here is no fixed
exclusion,&mdash;nothing of which there can be any just complaint,&mdash;nothing
which is not practical, wise, humane,&mdash;nothing
which is not born of justice rather than victory. In
the establishment of Equal Rights conquest loses its character,
and is no longer conquest,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘For then both parties nobly are subdued,</div>
<div class="verse">And neither party loser.’”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></div>
</div>
</div></div>

<h4>PERSONAL DUTY.</h4>

<p>Here I suspend this testimony. Such is the simple
and harmonious record, showing how from the beginning
I was devoted to peace,&mdash;how constantly I longed
for reconciliation,&mdash;how with every measure of Equal
Rights this longing found utterance,&mdash;how it became
an essential part of my life,&mdash;how I discarded all idea
of vengeance or punishment,&mdash;how Reconstruction was
to my mind a transition period,&mdash;and how earnestly I
looked forward to the day, when, after the recognition of
Equal Rights, the Republic should again be one in reality
as in name. If there are any who ever maintained
a policy of hate, I was never so minded; and now in
protesting against any such policy, I only act in obedience
to the irresistible promptings of my soul.</p>

<p>In embracing the opportunity unexpectedly presented
at this election, I keep myself still in harmony with the
past. Unable to vote a second time for President Grant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and confident that the choice of Horace Greeley will
tend to assure that triumph of peace which has occupied
so much of my desires, it only remains to vote for
him. I would not expect too much; but, knowing
something of the spirit in which the Democratic party
has adopted him as its candidate, and knowing something
also of his eminent character, I cannot doubt that
with his election there will be a new order of things,
where the harsh instrumentalities of power will yield to
a sentiment of good-will, and surviving irritations will
be lost in concord. The war is ended. There must
be an end also to belligerent passions; and the freedman,
assured in rights, must enter upon a new career
of happiness and prosperity. Such, at least, is the object
I now seek. Even those differing from me in faith
at this critical moment will not deny that such a result
would mark an epoch in American history. And
now, in the hope of its accomplishment, I forget personal
consequences, and think only of the inestimable
good.</p>

<h4>PREJUDICE AND INVENTION.</h4>

<p>The partisans of Reëlection, resorting to prejudice
and invention, insist, first, that the Democratic party,
which has adopted as its candidate an original Republican
on a Republican platform, will prove untrue, and,
secondly, that the candidate himself will prove untrue,&mdash;as
if the Democratic party were not bound now to
the very principles declared at Philadelphia, without
the viscous alloy of Grantism, and as if the life and
character of the candidate were not a sufficient answer
to any such slander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<h4>ADHESION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.</h4>

<p>Evidently there are individuals, calling themselves
Democrats, who feel little sympathy with the movement,
and there are others who insist upon the old hates,
whether towards the North or towards the freedman.
Unhappily, this is only according to human nature. It
must be so. Therefore, though pained in feeling, my
trust is not disturbed by sporadic cases cited in newspapers,
or by local incidents. This is clear: in spite of
politicians, and against their earnest efforts, the people
represented in the Democratic Convention adopted a
Republican nomination and platform. Baltimore answered
to Cincinnati. A popular uprising, stirred by
irresistible instinct, triumphed over all resistance. The
people were wiser than their leaders,&mdash;illustrating
again the saying of the French statesman, so experienced
in human affairs, that above the wisdom of any
individual, however great, is the wisdom of all. But
this testifies to that Providence which shapes our ends:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“So Providence for us, high, infinite,</div>
<div class="verse">Makes our necessities its watchful task.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Plainly in recent events there has been a presiding influence
against which all machinations have been powerless.
Had the Convention at Philadelphia nominated
a good Republican, truly representing Republican principles
without drawback, there is no reason to believe
that Horace Greeley would have been a candidate. The
persistence for President Grant dissolved original bonds,
and gave practical opportunity to the present movement.
The longing for peace, which in existing antagonisms of
party was without effective expression, at last found free
course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly the original Republican who had announced
himself ready to “clasp hands” in peace was
accepted on a Republican platform, declaring support of
the three Constitutional amendments, and placing in the
foreground the great truth that all men are equal before
the law. Such is the historic fact. That the party will
be disloyal to this act, that it will turn its back on its
covenants, and seek through a Republican President to
reverse these safeguards, or in any way impair their efficacy,
is not only without probability, but to imagine it
is absolutely absurd.</p>

<p>Beyond the unequivocal adhesion of the party in its
corporate capacity is that of eminent members who volunteer
as individuals in the same declarations, so that
personal pledge unites with party obligation. I quote
two instances at hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Hendricks, so well known for his service in the
National Senate, said recently in the Democratic State
Convention of Indiana, on his nomination for Governor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have this day substantially turned our backs upon the
Past. We now stand in the Present, and look forward to the
great Future. The Past is gone.”</p>

</div>

<p>Nobody in the country can speak for his party with
more authority; nor could there be better words to denote
the change that has occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerr, also of Indiana, an able Democratic Representative
in Congress, and now Congressional candidate
at large, bears the same testimony. In a recent speech
this distinguished Democrat says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The best impulse, the most patriotic sentiment, the most
intelligent judgment of the wisest and the best men of the
country now demand that the accomplished results of our great
civil war, as they are crystallized in the Amendments to the
Constitution, shall stand as parts of the fundamental law of
the country, to be obeyed and maintained in good faith, without
evasion, denial, or diminution, in favor of all classes of
the people. The Democratic party, in the most authoritative
and solemn manner, accepts this judgment.”</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing could be more complete. All the Amendments
are “to be obeyed and maintained in good faith,
without evasion, denial, or diminution, in favor of all
classes of the people”; and this is the covenant of the
Democratic party, countersigned by their Representative.
Not content with this unequivocal adhesion, the
speaker proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Any intelligent citizen, in public or private life, who
charges that the Democratic party, if invested with power,
would reëstablish slavery, or pay for slaves, or assume or pay
Confederate debts, and take suffrage from colored men, or do
other acts in defiance of the Constitution, must be a hypocrite
and a demagogue, and he can have no higher aim than to
slander and deceive.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is easy to pardon the indignation with which this
Democrat repels the calumnies employed to sow distrust.</p>

<p>In strictest harmony with these authorities is the
public press entitled to speak for the Democratic party.
Out of innumerable testimonies I content myself with
two.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati “Enquirer,” a leading Democratic
journal, of August 1st, alluding to myself, says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“His confidence in the honor of the Democratic party is
not misplaced. It will stand by the position which it assumed
at Baltimore, and maintain it under any and all circumstances.
Upon that he may depend.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then again the same Democratic organ says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It pleases some of the Grant papers to speak of Mr. Greeley
as a Democratic candidate, because he was nominated by
a Democratic Convention. They ignore the fact that he had
been previously nominated by a Republican Convention,&mdash;that
he has always been a Republican, and never cast a Democratic
ballot in his life. None of them have answered our
query, whether they would have considered General Grant
the Democratic candidate, if he had been nominated at Baltimore;
and if not, why do they make the difference between
him and Greeley?”</p>

</div>

<p>The Washington “Patriot,” the Democratic journal
at the national capital, of August 7th, thus explicitly
pronounces:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Democratic party have loyally and honorably conditioned
to uphold the Cincinnati platform and all its obligations.
<i>They mean to fulfil that bond in good faith and to the
last letter.</i> Hence not a word was altered at Baltimore, not a
letter changed, not a comma erased. <i>We took it in the exact
sense and in all the spirit of the several declarations, with
entire knowledge of the duty which they enjoined, and an honest
purpose to perform it at any cost.</i> So far from regarding that
acceptance as a sacrifice, it was welcomed everywhere with
joy.”</p>

</div>

<p>Are these speakers and these newspapers united in
conspiracy to deceive, or are they dupes? Spurning the
idea of dishonest conspiracy, I cannot doubt that they
believe what they say, and that what they say is true.
Again I insist that the sallies of local disaffection or
of personal brutality, however painful or discreditable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
cannot interfere to change the open adhesion of the
party, followed by declarations so authentic in form.
On this open adhesion and these declarations I act, and
to the complete fulfilment of all the obligations assumed
I feel that I may confidently hold the party.</p>

<h4>MOTIVES TO KEEP THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TRUE.</h4>

<p>But why should the Democratic party be untrue to
the covenants it has assumed? This imputation, so
insulting to a great political organization, and to the
distinguished members who have openly united in its
adhesion, cannot be accepted without some ground of
reason, or at least of presumption. But all reason and
every presumption are the other way. Men act according
to their supposed interests,&mdash;this is a law of human
nature; but every interest of former Rebels is for peace.
Under the influence of uncontrolled passion, and for the
sake of Slavery, they went into rebellion; but now that
passion has abated and Slavery has ceased, they see that
nothing is gained by prolonging the animosities it engendered.
Peace has become their absorbing interest.
So obvious is the advantage from this assured possession,
that it is unreasonable to suppose them indifferent
when it is within reach; it is absurd to imagine them
professing peace as a cover for war,&mdash;war in which
they know they must fail. This explains the promptitude
with which they seized the opportunity now presented.
At once they declared their desire and offered
the hand of fellowship, at the same time announcing
their acceptance of those great measures by which the
Equal Rights of All are assured.</p>

<p>The motives naturally governing former Rebels, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
accepting Horace Greeley and a Republican platform,
are plain. There is, first, the general prostration of their
region, which they would see improved; but this can be
only by the establishment of peace undisturbed, so that
all men, white and black, may live in security. This is
an essential condition. Violence breeds a kindred crop;
nor can distrust exist without detriment to all. Let either
appear, and the most fertile fields will fail in productive
power. Men will not mingle their sweat with the soil,
becoming colaborers with the sun,&mdash;they will not sow
and plough,&mdash;unless assured in the enjoyment of what
the generous earth is ready to yield. Above all, those
truest allies so essential to prosperous industry, capital
and immigration, will turn away from the land that is
not blessed by peace. Security is a constant invitation
and encouragement. There must be security in all
things,&mdash;security in life, security in property, and security
in rights, including Liberty and Equality, the
great promises of the Declaration of Independence. Let
any of these be in any peril, let any shadow rest upon
their enjoyment, and the whole community must suffer.
Therefore by the impulse of self-interest, now
clearly manifest, are the people of the South moved to
the present effort for peace.</p>

<p>This same motive assumes another form in the desire
to escape from existing misrule, which has left such traces
in the disordered finances of the Southern States.
So colossal has been the scale of plunder that even authentic
report seems like fable. Second only to the
wide-spread devastations of war are the robberies to
which these States have been subjected,&mdash;I am sorry
to say, under an Administration calling itself Republican,
at Washington, and with local governments deriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
their animating impulse from the party in power,
with the President as its dominant head. Surely the
people in these communities would have been less than
men, if, sinking under the intolerable burden, they did
not turn for help to a new party, promising reform and
honesty. They have seen custom-houses used to maintain
the plunderers in power; they have seen all available
political forces pressed to procure the renewed rule
of the President under whom they have suffered so
much; and they have seen this very President teach by
example that every office-holder should begin by looking
out for himself. It would be a wonder, if they did
not join the present movement and maintain its declared
purposes to the end.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that under these promptings, where
personal and local interests were so strong, Horace Greeley
was commended as a candidate, and then sincerely
accepted. They knew him as the steadfast enemy of
Slavery so long as it existed, dealing against it hard and
constant blows; they knew him as the faithful ally of
the freedman, insisting promptly upon his equal right
to suffrage, which he vindicated with persuasive power;
and they knew him also as the devoted friend of the colored
race, never failing in effort for their welfare: but
they knew also that he was a lover of peace and honesty,
whose soul had been transfigured in works, and
that, as sincerely as he had striven for the colored race,
he now strove to mitigate those other burdens which
had reduced them to a new slavery, being a debt which
was like chain and manacle upon their industry; and
they were assured that with <i>him</i> the great office for
which he is a candidate would be a trust and not a personal
perquisite, so that his example would be constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
testimony to industry, integrity, and fidelity in the discharge
of public duties, thus fixing a standard for all.
These things being evident, how could they hesitate?</p>

<h4>FAITH IN HORACE GREELEY.</h4>

<p>The partisans of Reëlection dwell much on the position
and character of Mr. Greeley, insisting that he
cannot be trusted in the Presidency,&mdash;partly because
helped into power by Democrats, and partly from an
alleged want of stability. It is difficult to hear these
barefaced allegations, in utter disregard of the prodigious
testimony afforded by his long career, without wonder
at the extent to which prejudice and invention can
be carried. Had he been presented at Philadelphia
with the saving sanction of a regular nomination, the
same partisans who now seek to exhibit him as a tool
or an imbecile would dwell with pride on his eminent
qualities, making him, by the side of his competitor, an
angel of light. Knowing them both, his superiority I
may affirm. To say that under him Slavery can in any
way be revived, or that the Rebel debt or the pension of
Rebel soldiers or compensation for slaves can find favor,
or that the equal rights of the freedmen, to which he
is so solemnly pledged, can in any way be impaired,&mdash;all
this is simply atrocious. Nothing of the kind can be
done without violation of the Constitution as amended,&mdash;not
to speak of the departure from that rule of life
which he has ever followed. There is no Democrat sympathizing
with his nomination who would not spurn the
infamous treachery. I dismiss the whole partisan extravagance
to the contempt it deserves.</p>

<p>The imputation that his election will be the return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
power of the old Democratic party is much like saying
that he will cease to be himself, and that his surpassing
individuality, making him so conspicuous, will be lost.
They who make the imputation forget that this old
party, if it has not ceased to exist, is changed in character.
Standing on a Republican platform, and with a
Republican candidate, it may look the Republican party
in the face, claiming for itself the Future, if not the
Past. Plainly it is not that Democratic party against
which Republicans have contended. If Democrats have
influence with Horace Greeley, it will be because they
have sincerely placed themselves by his side on a platform
which distinctly announces all that Republicans
have ever claimed.</p>

<p>Against all pretended distrust I oppose the open record
of his life. By this let him be judged. And here
it will be observed, that, while sometimes differing from
others in methods, he has never, at any moment, ceased
to be a champion, being always the same. Here is a
private letter, which has only recently appeared, being
a gleam of sunlight from his soul, which the dark days
of the war could not quench:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Office of the Tribune,<br />
New York</span>, June 26, 1863.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In God’s good time this is to be a
land of real freedom, where equal rights and equal laws shall
banish rebellion, treason, and riot, and all manner of kindred
diabolisms. I hardly hope to live to see that day, but hope
that those who may remember me, when I am gone, will believe
that I earnestly tried to hasten its coming.</p>

<p class="sig">Yours,</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>To suppose, that, under any circumstances of pressure
or temptation, he can fail in loyalty to the cause he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
served so constantly, is an offence to reason and to decency.
In his two letters of acceptance this loyalty
is nobly conspicuous. Replying to the nomination at
Cincinnati, he drew the wise line between “local self-government”
and “centralization,” asserting the former
as our true policy, “<i>subject</i> to our solemn constitutional
obligation to maintain the equal rights of all citizens,”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>&mdash;thus
placing these under national safeguard,
and making them absolutely the same in all parts of
the country. Replying to the nomination at Baltimore,
made after the enunciation of this master principle, he
announces his “hope and trust that the first century of
American Independence will not close before the grand
elemental truths on which its rightfulness was originally
based by Jefferson and the Continental Congress of 1776
will have become the universally accepted and honored
foundations of our political fabric.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> And thus is his
great record crowned.</p>

<p>Living so entirely in the public eye, all know his life,
which speaks for him now. Who so well as himself
could stand the trial? The “Tribune,” in its career of
more than thirty years, speaks for him also. Those opponents
who in the work of disparagement assert that he
wants executive ability, I point to this journal, begun
by Horace Greeley in 1841, without partner or business
associate, with a cash capital of only one thousand dollars,
and with but six hundred subscribers. And yet,
under his individual effort, by his amazing industry and
through his rare intelligence, with his determined nature
animating all, the enterprise prospered, until he found
himself at the head of one of the first newspapers of the
world, completely organized intellectually and mechanically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
with writers for every subject, with correspondents
everywhere at home and abroad, and with a constantly
increasing influence never surpassed in newspaper history.
A President with the ability that did all this
would impart new energy to the public service, impressing
it with his own faithful character, and assuring,
on a larger scale, a corresponding success, so that the
whole country would be gainer. Again, those opponents
who assert that Horace Greeley wants fidelity, or
that he can be easily swayed against life-long convictions,
I point to this same journal, which from the beginning,
and throughout the whole course of its existence, has
been an unwavering representative of the liberal cause,
foremost always in warfare with Slavery, prompt in support
of reform, inflexible in honesty, and a beacon-flame
to all struggling for human advancement.</p>

<p>Not to put faith in Horace Greeley is to act not only
without evidence, but against evidence so manifest and
constant in unbroken continuity as to seem like a law
of Nature. As well distrust the sun in its appointed
course.</p>

<h4>ANSWER TO TWO OBJECTIONS.</h4>

<p>Such is the easy answer to objectors who cry out,
that Democrats uniting with Republicans on a Republican
platform cannot be trusted, and that the candidate
himself cannot be trusted. The wantonness of partisanship
is too apparent in this pretension. I have considered
it carefully, as a lover of truth, and you have my
conclusion. Therefore do I say, Be not deterred from
voting for Horace Greeley because Democrats will also
vote for him, but rather rejoice. Their votes will be a
new bond of peace, and a new assurance for the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
principles declared by our fathers at our birth as a
nation.</p>

<h4>THE OLIVE-BRANCH AND EQUAL RIGHTS.</h4>

<p>And has not the time arrived when in sincerity we
should accept the olive-branch? Is it not time for the
pen to take the place of the sword? Is it not time for
the Executive Mansion to be changed from a barrack
cesspool to a life-giving fountain? Is it not time for
a President who will show by example the importance
of reform, and teach the duty of subordinating personal
objects to the public service? Is it not time for the
Head of the National Government to represent the idea
of peace and reconciliation, rather than of battle and
strife? Is it not time for that new era, when ancient
enemies, forgetting the past, shall “clasp hands” in true
unity with the principles of the Declaration of Independence
as the supreme law? Deploring the fate of
Poland and of Ireland, I seize the earliest moment to
escape from similar possibility here. Mindful that the
memories of the Past can only yield to a happy Present,
something would I do to promote this end. Anxious
for the Equal Rights of All, and knowing well that no
text of Law or Constitution is adequate without a supporting
sentiment behind, I cannot miss the opportunity
afforded by the present election of obtaining this strength
for our great guaranties.</p>

<p>Reconstruction is now complete. Every State is represented
in the Senate, and every District is represented
in the House of Representatives. Every Senator and
every Representative is in his place. There are no vacant
seats in either Chamber; and among the members
are fellow-citizens of the African race. And amnesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
nearly universal, has been adopted. In this condition
of things I find new reason for change. The present incumbent
knows little of our frame of government. By
military education and military genius he represents the
idea of Force; nor is he any exception to the rule of his
profession, which appreciates only slightly a government
that is not arbitrary. The time for the soldier has
passed, especially when his renewed power would once
more remind fellow-citizens of their defeat. Victory
over fellow-citizens should be known only in the rights
it assures; nor should it be flaunted in the face of the
vanquished. It should not be inscribed on regimental
colors, or portrayed in pictures at the National Capitol.
But the present incumbent is a regimental color with the
forbidden inscription; he is a picture at the National
Capitol recalling victories over fellow-citizens. It is
doubtful if such a presence can promote true reconciliation.
Friendship does not grow where former differences
are thrust into sight. There are wounds of the
mind as of the body; these, too, must be healed. Instead
of irritation and pressure, let there be gentleness
and generosity. Men in this world get only what they
give,&mdash;prejudice for prejudice, animosity for animosity,
hate for hate. Likewise confidence is returned for confidence,
good-will for good-will, friendship for friendship.
On this rule, which is the same for the nation as for the
individual, I would now act. So will the Republic be
elevated to new heights of moral grandeur, and our
people will manifest that virtue, “greatest of all,” which
is found in charity. Above the conquest of others will
be the conquest of ourselves. Nor will any fellow-citizen
suffer in rights, but all will find new safeguard in
the comprehensive fellowship.</p>

<p>The death of Mr. Greeley at the close of the canvass in which nearly
three millions of his fellow-citizens had given him their suffrages for the
Presidency, seemed, in the view of leading Senators on both sides, to require
from their body a respectful recognition of the day appointed for
his funeral; and it was accordingly arranged that a motion for adjournment
on this occasion should be offered by Mr. Fenton, of New York,
and seconded by Mr. Sumner, with appropriate remarks by each. But
a dominant party-spirit, by recourse to parliamentary tactics, prevented
its introduction, and the day passed without notice. The remarks designed
by Mr. Sumner were as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I have been requested to second
this motion. One word, if you please. A
funeral will take place to-morrow, on which the eyes
of the nation will rest, while innumerable hearts throb
with grief, and the people everywhere learn the instability
of life and the commandment of charity. It is
proper, therefore, for the representatives of the nation to
suspend labor, that they too may be penetrated by the
lesson of the day. More for them than the illustrious
dead is this needed. He is gone beyond any earthly
call; we remain. Duties are always for the living; and
now, standing at the open grave of <span class="smcap">Horace Greeley</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
we are admonished to forget the strifes of party, and to
remember only truth, country, and mankind, to which
his honest life was devoted. In other days the horse
and armor of the departed chieftain have been buried in
the grave where he reposed. So, too, may we bury the
animosities, if not the badges, of the past. Then, indeed,
will there be victory for the dead which all will
share.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, December 12, 1872.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The subject under consideration was a bill from the House providing
for a drawback of the duties on all materials imported into Boston for
the rebuilding of that portion of the city laid waste by the recent conflagration,&mdash;with
amendments, including one excepting lumber, proposed
by the Committee on Finance, to whom the bill had been referred.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Hoping that the Senate will
not be less generous than the House of Representatives,
I trust that we shall take the bill as it comes
from the House, voting down the amendments reported
by our Committee.</p>

<p>I hear it said by the Senator from Michigan [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Ferry</span>] that the bill will be a bad precedent; and the
same argument is repeated, with variety of illustration,
by my excellent friend the Senator from Vermont [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Morrill</span>]. Sir, is it not too late to correct the precedent?
You already have the case of Portland and the
case of Chicago; I am sorry that you must now add the
case of Boston. Call it a bad precedent. It can only
be applicable in a parallel case, and I do not believe such
cases can occur often. The fire-fiend latterly has been
very busy in our land; but he cannot always be so; at
least I have a well-founded trust that by proper precaution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
if not also by better fortune, we shall escape
from his visitations. I put aside, therefore, the argument
that this is a bad precedent. It can be called into
activity only in a similar case; and when a similar case
occurs, I am ready for its application. Let any other metropolis
sit like Boston in ashes, and I hope there will
be no hesitation in extending to it a friendly hand.</p>

<p>It is not fair to call up the smaller losses that may
occur in smaller places, for the simple reason that such
losses are not within the reach of Congress by any ordinary
exercise of its powers. It is only where the loss is
great, as in the familiar cases before us, that there is opportunity
for Congress. An ancient poet says: “Nor
should the Divinity intervene, unless the occasion be
worthy.”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> I would say, Nor should Congress interfere,
unless the case be such as to justify the exercise of extraordinary
powers. Obviously such an occasion does
not occur except where the scale of loss is great.</p>

<p>Then, again, the Senator from Michigan reminded
us of the exception of lumber in the bill for the relief
of Chicago; but he vindicated that exception by facts
which do not occur in the present case. He said, as we
all know, that Michigan was also a sufferer at that calamitous
moment; and he did not think it right, therefore,
that the peculiar interests of his State should be
called to contribute even to the great losses of Chicago.
I do not say that the Senator was not entirely right in
that position. Certainly the case as presented by him is
entirely reasonable. Had I had the honor to represent
Michigan at the time, I know not that I should have
acted otherwise than he did. But I call attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the point, as presented by him, that no such case exists
now. Michigan is not a sufferer; Maine is not a sufferer;
nor is any part of our country which contributes
timber to our business a sufferer. Therefore is there no
reason for introducing this exception. The reason failing,
the exception should fail also. I hope, therefore,
that the Senate will keep the bill in that respect precisely
as it came from the House.</p>

<p>Then my friend from Vermont suggests that this bill
is practically an invitation to the people of Boston to go
to Europe and elsewhere in order to find workmen. He
seemed frightened at the possibility. I think my friend
sees too often the question of protection to American
industry, and makes himself too unhappy on this account.
I hope that this bill will be considered without
any question of protection. Let the people of Boston
go where they can buy cheapest in order to meet
their great calamity; and if it be to their neighbor British
provinces, I hope my friend from Vermont will not
interfere to prevent it.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LATE_HON_GARRETT_DAVIS_SENATOR" id="THE_LATE_HON_GARRETT_DAVIS_SENATOR"></a>THE LATE HON. GARRETT DAVIS, SENATOR
OF KENTUCKY.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate on his Death, December 18,
1872.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I was a member of the Senate,
when, in 1861, our departed Senator entered
it; and I was to the end the daily witness of his laborious
service. Standing now at his funeral, it is easy to
forget the differences between us and remember those
things in which he was an example to all.</p>

<p>Death has its companionship. In its recent autumn
harvest were Garrett Davis, William H. Seward, and
Horace Greeley. Seward was the precise contemporary
of Davis, each beginning life with the century and dying
within a few days of each other. Always alike in
constancy of labor, they were for the larger part of this
period associated in political sentiment as active members
of the old Whig party. But the terrible question
of Slavery rose to divide them. How completely they
were on opposite sides I need not say. Horace Greeley
was ten years the junior, but he was the colleague and
peer of Garrett Davis in devotion to Henry Clay. In
the whole country, among all whose enthusiastic support
he aroused, there was no one who upheld the Kentucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
statesman with more chivalrous devotion than
these two. Here they were alike, and in the record of
life this signal fidelity cannot be forgotten. It was to
the honor of Henry Clay that he inspired this sentiment
in such men, and it was to their honor that they maintained
it so truly. Kindred to truth is fidelity.</p>

<p>At his death, Garrett Davis was our Congressional
senior, having entered the other House as early as 1839,
after previous service of six years in the Legislature of
Kentucky. For eight years he sat as Representative,
and then, after an interval of thirteen years, he was
for nearly twelve years Senator. During this long period
he was conspicuous before the country, dwelling
constantly in the public eye. How well he stood
the gaze, whether of friend or foe, belongs to his good
name.</p>

<p>All who knew him in the Senate will bear witness to
his wonderful industry, his perfect probity, and the personal
purity of his life. No differences of opinion can
obscure the fame of these qualities, or keep them from
being a delight to his friends and an example to his
country. Nor can any of us forget how, amid peculiar
trials, he was courageous in devotion to the National
Union. No pressure, no appeal, no temptation, could
sway him in this patriotic allegiance. That fidelity
which belonged to his nature shone here as elsewhere.
He was no holiday Senator, cultivating pleasure rather
than duty, and he was above all suspicion in personal
conduct. Calumny could not reach him. Nothing is
so fierce and unreasoning as the enmities engendered by
political antagonists; but even these never questioned
that he was at all times incorruptible and pure. Let
this be spoken in his honor; let it be written on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
monument. Nor can the State that gave him to the
national service and trusted him so long fail to remember
with pride that he was always an honest man.</p>

<p>With this completeness of integrity there was a certain
wild independence and intensity of nature which
made him unaccommodating and irrepressible. Faithful,
constant, devoted, indefatigable, implacable, he knew
not how to capitulate. Dr. Johnson, who liked “a good
hater,”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> would have welcomed him into this questionable
fellowship. Here I cannot doubt. Better far the
opposite character, and even the errors that may come
from it. Kindred to hate is prejudice, which was too
often active in him, seeming at times, especially where
we differed from him, to take the place of reason. On
nothing was this so marked as Slavery. Here his convictions
were undisguised; nor did they yield to argument
or the logic of events. How much of valuable
time, learned research, and intellectual effort he bestowed
in support of this dying cause, the chronicles of
the Senate attest. How often have we listened with
pain to this advocacy, regretting deeply that the gifts
he possessed, and especially his sterling character, were
enlisted where our sympathies could not go! And yet
I cannot doubt that others would testify, as I now do,
that never on these occasions, when the soul was tried
in its depths, did any fail to recognize the simplicity and
integrity of his nature. Had he been less honest, I
should have felt his speeches less. Happily, that great
controversy is ended; nor do I say anything but the
strict truth, when I add that now we bury him who
spoke last for Slavery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>Time is teacher and reconciler; nor is it easy for any
candid nature to preserve a constant austerity of judgment
toward persons. As evening approaches, the meridian
heats lose their intensity. While abiding firmly
in the truth as we saw it, there may be charity and consideration
for those who did not see it as we saw it. A
French statesman, yet living, whose name is indissolubly
connected with the highest literature, as well as with
some of the most important events of his age, teaches
how with the passage of life the judgment is softened
toward others. “The more,” says M. Guizot, “I have penetrated
into an understanding and experience of things,
of men, and of myself, the more I have perceived at the
same time my general convictions strengthen and my
personal impressions become calm and mild. Equity,
I will not say toleration for the faith of others, in religion
or politics, has come to take place and grow by the
side of tranquillity in my own faith. It is youth, with
its natural ignorance and passionate prejudices, which
renders us exclusive and biting in our judgments of
others. In proportion as I quit myself, and as time
sweeps me far from our combats, I enter without difficulty
into a serene and pleasant appreciation of ideas
and sentiments which do not belong to me.” Even if
not adopting these words completely, all will confess
their beauty.</p>

<p>Here let me be frank. Nothing could make any
speech for Slavery tolerable to me; but when I think
how much opinions are determined by the influences
about us, so that a change of birth and education might
have made the Abolitionist a partisan of Slavery and
the partisan of Slavery an Abolitionist, I feel, that,
while always unrelenting toward the wrong, we cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
be insensible to individual merits. In this spirit I
offer a sincere tribute to a departed Senator, who, amid
the perturbations of the times, trod his way with independent
step, and won even from opponents the palm
of character.</p>

<h3>MR. SUMNER’S REPLY.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, July 4, 1873.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I cannot, at this late day, acknowledge
the letter with which you have honored
me, without explaining the reason of my delay.</p>

<p>Owing to absence in Europe, where I had gone for
my health, I did not receive your valuable communication
until some time in the winter, when it was put
into my hands by your excellent Minister. Continuing
feeble in health, I reluctantly postponed this acknowledgment.
I now take advantage of convalescence to
do, thus tardily, what my feelings prompted at an earlier
day.</p>

<p>Please, Sir, accept my thanks for your generous appreciation
of what I have done, and your kindness in
letting me know it under your own hand. But I beg
you to understand that I do not deserve the praise with
which you honor me. In advocating the cause of an
oppressed people I have only acted according to my
conscience. I could not have done otherwise; and now
my only regret is that I have done so little. I wish I
had done more.</p>

<p>In the history of mankind the crime against the African
race will stand forth in terrible eminence,&mdash;always
observed, and never forgotten. Just in proportion as
civilization prevails will this enormous wrong be apparent
in its true character; and men will read with astonishment
how human beings, guilty only of being black,
were sold into slavery, and then (such was the continuing
injustice towards this unhappy people) how, when
slavery ceased, they were still treated with indignity by
persons whose lordly pretensions were founded on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
skin only. As these things are seen in increasing light,
they will be condemned in no uncertain words; nor will
the denial of equal rights, on account of color, escape
the judgment awarded to slavery itself. Human conduct
on this question is a measure of character. Where
the African race is enslaved or degraded, where it is exposed
to any indignity or shut out from that equality
which is a primal right to humanity, there civilization
is still feeble.</p>

<p>To the certain triumph of civilization I look with
constant hope. It is sure to come; and one sign of its
arrival will be that prevailing sentiment which recognizes
the perpetual obligations of equal justice to all,
and the duty to repair past wrongs by compensations
in the future.</p>

<p>In the great debt of the whites to the blacks there is
a bank from which, for generations to come, the latter
can draw.</p>

<p>Accept, Mr. President, the expression of my ardent
hope for the peace, prosperity, and happiness of the Republic
of Hayti, and allow me to subscribe myself with
true regard,</p>

pleasure than the vote on your motion. I thank
you for making the motion; and I thank you also for
not yielding to Mr. Gladstone’s request to withdraw it.
You were in the very position of Buxton on his motion

appear on the wrong side. What fame so great as his,
if he would devote the just influence of his lofty position
to securing for nations the inappreciable benefits of a

<p>How absurd to call your motion Utopian, if by this
word is meant that it is not practical. There is no
question so supremely practical; for it concerns not
merely one nation, but every nation; and even its discussion
promises to diminish the terrible chances of war.
Its triumph would be the greatest reform of history.
And I doubt not that this day is near.</p>

July 29, 1873.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, July 29, 1873.</p>

<p class="dropcap">GENTLEMEN,&mdash;I am honored by your communication
of July 26th, in which, after congratulating
me upon returning health, and expressing your
sincere hopes that I may resume my labors in the Senate,
there to take up again the cause of Equal Rights,
you mention that the colored citizens of Washington
are now engaged in agitating what you properly call
“a common-school system for all children.”</p>

<p>I desire to thank you for the good-will to myself
which your communication exhibits, and for your hopes
that I may again in the Senate take up the cause of
Equal Rights. Health itself is valuable only as it enables
us to perform the duties of life, and I know no
present duty more commanding than that to which
you refer.</p>

<p>I confess a true pleasure in learning that the colored
people are at last rising to take the good cause into their
own hands, because through them its triumph is certain.
But they must be in earnest. They must insist and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
labor, then labor and insist again. Only in this way can
indifference, which is worse even than the stubbornness
of opposition, be overcome. The open foe can be met.
It is hard to deal with that dulness which feels no throb
at the thought of opening to all complete equality in
the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>Permit me to remind you, Gentlemen, that, living at
the national capital, you have a peculiar responsibility.
In the warfare for Equal Rights you are the advance
guard, sometimes the forlorn hope. You are animated
to move forward, not only for your own immediate good,
but because through you the whole colored population
of the country will be benefited. What is secured for
you will be secured for all,&mdash;while, if you fail, there is
small hope elsewhere. Do not forget&mdash;and let this
thought arouse to increased exertion&mdash;that your triumph
will redound to the good of all.</p>

<p>The District of Columbia is the place where all the
great reforms born of the war have begun. It is the
experimental garden and nursery where all the generous
plants have been tried. Emancipation, colored suffrage,
the right of colored persons to testify, and the right to
ride in the street-cars,&mdash;all these began here, and I remember
well how they were all encountered.</p>

<p>On the abolition of Slavery we were solemnly warned
that riot, confusion, and chaos would ensue. Emancipation
took place, and not a voice or sound was heard
except of peace and gladness. I was soberly assured by
eminent politicians, that if colored persons were allowed
to vote there would be massacre at the polls. Then,
again, colored testimony was deprecated,&mdash;while it was
insisted that the street-cars would be ruined, if opened
to colored persons. But all these changes, demanded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
simple justice, have been in every way beneficent. Nobody
would reverse them now. Who would establish
Slavery again? Who would drive the colored citizen
from the polls? Who would exclude him from the
court-room? Who would shut him from the street-cars?
And now the old objections are revived, and
made to do service again, in order to defeat the effort
for common schools,&mdash;being schools founded on the
very principle of Equal Rights recognized in the elective
franchise, in the court-room, and in the street-car.
If this principle is just for all the latter,&mdash;and nobody
says the contrary now,&mdash;why hesitate to apply it in
education? How often we are enjoined to train the
child in the way he should go! Why, then, compel
him in those tender years to bear the ban of exclusion?
Why, at that early period, when impressions are received
for life, impose upon him the badge of inferiority? He
is to be a man; therefore he must be trained to that
self-respect without which there can be no true manhood.
But this can be only by removing all ban of exclusion,
and every badge of inferiority from color.</p>

<p>As the old objections are revived, so again do I present
the great truth announced by our fathers in the
Declaration of Independence, “that all men are created
equal.” Admitting this principle as a rule of conduct,
the separation of children in the public schools on account
of color is absolutely indefensible. In abolishing
it we simply bring our schools into conformity with the
requirements of the Declaration.</p>

<p>To the objection that this change will injure the
schools, I reply that this is contrary to experience in
other places, where the commingling of children according
to the genius of republican institutions has been found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
excellent in influence. And I further reply by insisting
now, as I always do, upon that justice to an oppressed
race which has been too long delayed, and which never
fails to be a well-spring of strength and happiness, blessing
all who help it and all who receive it.</p>

<p>Feeling as I do on this question, you will understand
that I cannot see without regret any opportunity neglected
of advancing the cause, especially among colored
fellow-citizens. On this they should be a unit. Wherever
the question presents itself, whether in Congress, or
the Legislative Chambers of the District, or the popular
assembly, there should be a solid vote against every discrimination
on account of color. It is easy for lawyers
and politicians to find excuses according to their desires;
but no fine-spun theory or technicality should be allowed
to prevail against the commanding principle.</p>

<p>Accept my best wishes, and believe me, Gentlemen,</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Letter to Hon. G. W. Warren, of Charlestown, on the
Annexion to Boston of the Suburban Towns, October
4, 1873.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Coolidge House</span>, October 4, 1873.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR MR. WARREN,&mdash;I should be glad to meet
your friends in a conference on the question,
How Boston shall be rounded so as to be in reality itself.
I cannot meet with you, but I unite in your purpose,
as I understand it, and especially with regard to
Charlestown.</p>

<p>I doubt if the future Boston will be content until it
holds and possesses all the territory which hugs the harbor
bearing its name, so that in Boston harbor nobody
shall land except in Boston.</p>

<p>Evidently Boston should contain all Bostonians, which
it does not now. I know no better way of accomplishing
this result than by widening the circle of its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>But there is a stronger reason. Every capital is a
natural focus of life, politically, socially, and commercially;
and every person living in this natural focus
properly belongs to the capital. So it is with London,
Paris, and Vienna,&mdash;each of which is composed of suburbs
and faubourgs grouped about the original city;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
and so in reality it is with Boston,&mdash;for the places
about the city, though called by different names, are
parts of the same unity, which needs nothing now
but a common name.</p>

<p>A capital may be artificial or natural. The artificial
body is that formed by original unchangeable boundaries.
The natural body is that combination, cluster, or
expansion which changes with the developments of time
and to meet the growing exigencies.</p>

<p>With these views, I find the various processes of annexion
only a natural manifestation, to be encouraged
always, and to be welcomed under proper conditions of
population and public opinion. I say “annexion”
rather than “annexation.” Where a word is so much
used, better save a syllable,&mdash;especially as the shorter
is the better.</p>

<p class="sig">Ever sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks before the Board of Trade at Boston,

<div class="medium">

<p>At a meeting in aid of the sufferers by yellow fever in Memphis
(Tennessee) and Shreveport (Louisiana), held at the rooms of the
Board of Trade in Boston, at which the Mayor, Hon. Henry L. Pierce,
presided, after remarks by Mr. Pierce and Hon. Alexander H. Rice,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. MAYOR,&mdash;I have come less for speech than
to show by my presence here the sincere interest
I feel in the present meeting. For what can I say
to prompt the generosity of Boston merchants? They
understand this call, and their hearts have already answered
it.</p>

<p>It is hard to hear of suffering anywhere without longing
to relieve it. But happily now all impediment of
distance is removed; and such are the facilities of communication
that before the set of sun your contributions
will brighten the faces of those distant sufferers. Do not
think of distance. It is nothing. If Boston should be
startled by hearing to-day that pestilence had appeared
in one of our new-found possessions, as in Charlestown,&mdash;or
even in Brookline, which will not be annexed,&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
should feel the ties of neighborhood. But Memphis
and Shreveport are neighbors by telegraph and steam,
and the grander ties of a common country, which the
ancient Roman orator called the “great charity comprehending
all.”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Besides, there is that other more touching
neighborhood which springs from suffering,&mdash;for I
do not forget the divine hymn which teaches that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Our neighbor is the suffering man,</div>
<div class="verse">Though at the farthest pole.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In these latter days, my friends, distress has come
less from pestilence than from conflagration. The Fire
Fiend has been more active than the other demon, and
property has suffered more than life. Such are the favoring
conditions of climate and the general security of
health in our country, that we are rarely disturbed by
contagion. But it has come at last with the “reaper
whose name is Death.”</p>

<p>To arrest this contagion, to help those exposed to its
ravages, we perform a simple duty, as when we direct
water upon the bursting blaze. Pestilence is a conflagration,
and human life is the sacrifice. In this illustration
I bring home to Boston merchants the urgency
of the present call. Too well you know the terrible
scene, when your magnificent and well-filled warehouses,
borrowed in style and form from Venetian palaces, were
seized and devoured by the flames. But other flames,
not less vindictive, are now seizing and devouring fellow-men,
our fellow-countrymen, in fair and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
places where all smiles but the benefactor Health. Let
us do what we can to help the benefactor resume his
sway.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Letter to the Cuban Mass Meeting in New York,
November 15, 1873.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Virginius, a steamer sailing from New York under American
colors, was seized on her way from Jamaica to Cuba by a Spanish
cruiser, the Tornado, on the ground that she was carrying men and
munitions of war to the Cuban insurgents, and a large number of those
on board were summarily executed by order of the Spanish authorities
in that island. The intelligence caused much excitement, especially in
the City of New York, which was the centre of Cuban interests in this
country. An indignation meeting was held in that City, which was
countenanced by persons of high character and position, and addressed
by Hon. William M. Evarts and others in speeches of great intensity.
Mr. Sumner, taking a view of the case which the sober second thought
of the people approved, but which was not in accord with the passions
of the hour, answered an invitation to attend the meeting by the
following letter:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, November 15, 1873.</p>

<p class="dropcap">GENTLEMEN,&mdash;It is not in my power to be with
you at your meeting to ask for justice in Cuba.</p>

<p>Allow me to add, that, longing for immediate Emancipation
in this neighboring island, where Slavery still
shows its infamous front, and always insisting that delay
is contrary to justice, I do not think it practicable
at this moment, on existing evidence, to determine all
our duties in the recent case where civilization has received
a shock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very easy to see that no indignation at dreadful
butchery&mdash;inconsistent with the spirit of the age, but
unhappily aroused by an illicit filibustering expedition
from our own shores, kindred to that of the Alabama,
for which England has been justly condemned in damages&mdash;can
make us forget that we are dealing with the
Spanish nation, struggling under terrible difficulties to
become a sister Republic, and therefore deserving from
us present forbearance and candor. Nor can we forget
the noble President, whose eloquent voice, pleading for
humanity and invoking our example, has so often
charmed the world. The Spanish Republic and Emilio
Castelar do not deserve the menace of war from us.</p>

<p>If watchwords are needed now, let them be: Immediate
Emancipation and Justice in Cuba!&mdash;Success
to the Spanish Republic!&mdash;Honor and Gratitude to
Emilio Castelar! and Peace between our two Nations!
Bearing these in mind, there will be no occasion for
the belligerent preparations of the last few days, adding
to our present burdensome expenditures several
millions of dollars, and creating a war fever to interfere
with the general health of the political body.</p>

AGAIN: IMMEDIATE ACTION URGED.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, December 2, 1873.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;If the Senate has no business
before it, I think it cannot do better than to
proceed to the consideration of Senate bill No. 1, the
Bill Supplementary to the Civil-Rights Act.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> It is a
well-known bill, and I do not see how it will require
any debate. I think its reading will be enough. Its
terms are expressive; the bill proves itself. I move
that the Senate proceed to its consideration.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Ferry, of Connecticut, objecting, that on the introduction of
this bill, the day before, Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, who was not now
in his seat, had expressed an earnest desire that it should be referred to
a committee, a feeling in which he himself sympathized, “especially
because the constitutional question which was prominent in the former
debate on it had been submitted to the consideration of the Supreme
Court of the United States, and its decision promulgated since the
Senate last met,”&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;This bill has been before a committee.
What the committee did in the way of consideration
I know not; I had not the honor of being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
member of it. But afterward, as all know, this bill was
completely, most thoroughly, considered and canvassed
in this Chamber. Never in the history of our legislation
was any bill more considered; never has any bill
been more minutely matured. Why, then, refer it to
a committee? I do not say that Senators propose
delay, but it is obvious that such a reference will cause
delay.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I am against delay in the enactment of this
measure. It should pass promptly. It is a great act of
justice, to which, as I understand, the political parties of
the country, in solemn convention, are pledged. Why,
then, wait? Why charge a committee with this burden?
Why continue on the country the burden of the
injustice which this bill proposes to relieve?</p>

<p>We are reminded of a recent decision of the Supreme
Court. I have yet to learn how that decision has any
practical bearing on the present bill. I do not believe
that it touches it. Why, then, interpose this delay?
Why not go forward promptly, swiftly, according to the
merits of this measure, and give it, like a benediction, to
the land? Here are our colored fellow-citizens, many
millions strong, all of whom have votes, and all unite in
asking it. Your table has literally groaned under petitions
presented from month to month, from year to year;
and unless the bill is speedily passed, I predict that your
table will groan again with similar petitions, and justly,&mdash;for
our colored fellow-citizens ought to exercise that
great right of petition in favor of this measure until it
is finally adopted.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the suggestion has been made. I had
hoped that there would be nothing but welcome and
consideration for a measure so truly beneficent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
which is absolutely needed to crown and complete the
great work of Reconstruction.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Ferry reiterating his objections, with the remark that this bill
had “in its principle been considered by the Supreme Court of the
United States,” and its constitutionality “substantially decided
against,” and to Mr. Sumner’s inquiry, “When, and on what occasion?”
responding,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the New Orleans Slaughter-house cases; and I have read in the
newspapers of the country during the recent vacation what purported to be
the opinion of the Supreme Court; and if the paper which I read was the
opinion of the Supreme Court, that court, by a majority, holds in principle
that the bill which the Senator has presented is a violation of the Constitution
of the United States,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner rejoined:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I would not fail in any courtesy to
any Senator, especially in any courtesy to the Senator
from Vermont, for whom I have all kindness and honor,
but I think Senators will agree that nothing passed
yesterday between us by which I am in any way constrained,
so that I may not ask the Senate to proceed at
once with this bill. If I could see the question as my
friend from Connecticut sees it, he may be assured that
I should not press the bill. I do not see it so; but I
do see that this bill is now on our table numbered <i>One</i>:
it is the first bill of the Calendar. I see also that at
this time the Senate has no business before it; and
should I not fail in duty, if I did not ask the Senate to
proceed during this unoccupied time with a bill which
I regard as so important, and which is actually the first
in order, being foremost among all bills?</p>

<p>But my friend from Connecticut reminds me of a recent
decision of the Supreme Court. For that Court I
have great respect. Personal and professional familiarity
with the Court, and study of its judgments running now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
for much more than a generation, incline me always to
deference when its decisions are mentioned; but if I
understood my friend, he relies upon a newspaper report.
Sir, I have read the judgment of that Court, communicated
to me by one of its members in an official
copy; and I have no hesitation in saying that the Senator
is entirely mistaken, if he supposes that by a hair’s
breadth it interferes with the constitutionality of the
bill which I now move.</p>

<p>Sir, there is no such lion in our path. It exists only
in the imagination of my friend,&mdash;or in the desire,
which he has so often manifested, to interfere with the
adoption of this measure. But the Senator is mistaken
if he supposes that I charge upon him any indifference
to Human Rights. Never, in any debate, has any word
fallen from me which that Senator can so misinterpret.
I know too well his heart, his excellent and abounding
nature, his New-England home, to attribute to
him any such indifference. But I do know full well,
for the Senator has often declared it, that he acts under
interpretations of the Constitution which it seems to me
belong to the period anterior to the war rather than since
the war. It seems to me&mdash;I may be mistaken, but I
cannot help saying it&mdash;that the Senator has not yet recognized
that greatest of all victories by which a new
interpretation is fixed upon the National Constitution,
so that hereafter all its sentences, all its phrases, all its
words, shall be interpreted broadly and emphatically for
Human Rights. How often have I been obliged to say
this! But the Senator forgets that victory. There is
his error. Most sincerely, most ardently, do I trust that
the Senate will never forget it; I hope we shall duly
act upon it, and celebrate it in our acts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir, I have been betrayed into these remarks simply
by way of answer to what has been said by my friend.
I had hoped that this bill might be proceeded with
without debate. I had trusted that this benign measure
was so clear and refulgent with justice that no Senator
would rise in his place to oppose it. I had indulged
the longing that those especially in favor of amnesty
for all would adopt that other greater and more
comprehensive principle of justice for all. Strange, Sir,
that the sensibilities of so many are aroused in favor of
amnesty, and yet those same Senators are so dull when
the rights of men are presented! I, Sir, am anxious to
see universal amnesty; but with it must be asserted also
universal justice. Our colored fellow-citizens must be
admitted to complete equality before the law. In other
words, everywhere, in everything regulated by law, they
must be equal with all their fellow-citizens. There is
the simple principle on which this bill stands. Who
can impugn it? Who can throw upon it the shadow of
question? Sir, if the Constitution of the United States
does not sanction a bill like this, then forthwith should
we proceed to amend that Constitution, and make it
more worthy of our regard. Much as has been done,
this bill must also be added to the trophies of Congressional
action; this bill must be enumerated among the
great results of our recent legislation. Terrible war will
then have been a beneficent parent.</p>

<p>I hope, Sir, there can be no question on the subject.</p>

<p class="dropcap">For the first time in my life, I have the good fortune
to enjoy this famous anniversary festival.
Though often honored by your most tempting invitation,
and longing to celebrate the day in this goodly company,
of which all have heard so much, I could never
excuse myself from duties in another place. If now I
yield to well-known attractions, and journey from Washington
for my first holiday during a protracted public

of your excellent President, to whom I am bound by the

<p>It is with much doubt and humility that I venture to

(<i>Laughter.</i>) But I shall be entirely safe in expressing
my doubt if there is a single Senator who would not be
glad of a seat at this generous banquet. What is the
Senate? It is a component part of the National Government.
But we celebrate to-day more than any component
part of any government. We celebrate an epoch
in the history of mankind,&mdash;not only never to be forgotten,
but to grow in grandeur as the world appreciates
the elements of true greatness. Of mankind, I say: for
the landing on Plymouth Rock, on the 22d of December,
1620, marks the origin of a new order of ages, by which
the whole human family will be elevated. Then and
there was the great beginning.</p>

<p>Throughout all time, from the dawn of history, men
have swarmed to found new homes in distant lands.
The Tyrians, skirting Northern Africa, stopped at Carthage;
Carthaginians dotted Spain, and even the distant
coasts of Britain and Ireland; Greeks gemmed Italy and
Sicily with Art-loving settlements; Rome carried multitudinous
colonies with her conquering eagles. Saxons,
Danes, and Normans violently mingled with the original
Britons. And in more modern times Venice, Genoa,
Portugal, Spain, France, and England, all sent forth emigrants
to people foreign shores. But in these various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
expeditions trade or war was the impelling motive. Too
often commerce and conquest moved hand in hand, and
the colony was incarnadined with blood.</p>

<p>On the day we celebrate, the sun for the first time in
his course looked down upon a different scene, begun
and continued under a different inspiration. A few
conscientious Englishmen, in obedience to the monitor
within, and that they might be free to worship God according
to their own sense of duty, set sail for the unknown
wilds of the North American continent. After
a voyage of sixty-four days in the ship Mayflower, with
Liberty at the prow and Conscience at the helm, (<i>applause</i>,)
they sighted the white sand-banks of Cape Cod,
and soon thereafter in the small cabin framed that brief
compact, forever memorable, which is the first written
constitution of government in human history, and the
very corner-stone of the American Republic; and then
these Pilgrims landed.</p>

<p>This compact was not only foremost in time, it was
also august in character, and worthy of perpetual example.
Never before had the object of the “civil body
politic” been announced as “to enact, constitute, and
frame such <i>just and equal laws</i>, ordinances, acts, constitutions,
and offices, from time to time, as shall be thought
most meet and convenient for the general good of the
Colony.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> How lofty! how true! Undoubtedly these
were the grandest words of government, with the largest
promise, of any at that time uttered.</p>

<p>If more were needed to illustrate the new epoch, it
would be found in the parting words of the venerable
pastor, John Robinson, addressed to the Pilgrims, as
they were about to sail from Delft-Haven,&mdash;words often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
quoted, yet never enough. How sweetly and beautifully
he says: “And if God should reveal anything to
you by any other instrument of His, be as ready to receive
it as ever you were to receive any truth by my
ministry; for I am very confident the Lord hath more
truth and light yet to break forth out of His Holy
Word.” And then how justly the good preacher rebukes
those who close their souls to truth! “As, for example,
the Lutherans, they cannot be drawn to go beyond what
Luther saw,&mdash;for, whatever part of God’s will He hath
further imparted and revealed to Calvin, they will rather
die than embrace it; and so also you see the Calvinists,
they stick where he left them,&mdash;a misery much to be lamented;
for, though they were precious shining lights
in their times, yet God had not revealed His whole will
to them.”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Beyond the merited rebuke, here is a plain
recognition of the law of Human Progress, little discerned
at the time, which teaches the sure advance of
the Human Family, and opens the vista of the ever-broadening,
never-ending future on earth.</p>

<p>Our Pilgrims were few and poor. The whole outfit of
this historic voyage, including £1,700 of trading-stock,
was only £2,400;<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and how little was required for their
succor appears in the experience of the soldier Captain
Miles Standish, who, being sent to England for assistance,&mdash;not
military, but financial (God save the mark!),&mdash;succeeded
in borrowing (how much do you suppose?)
£150 sterling. (<i>Laughter.</i>) Something in the way of
help; and the historian adds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> “though at fifty per cent”
interest.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> So much for a valiant soldier on a financial
expedition. (<i>Laughter, in which General Sherman
and the company joined.</i>) A later agent, Allerton, was
able to borrow for the Colony £200 at a reduced interest
of thirty per cent.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Plainly, the money-sharks of
our day may trace an undoubted pedigree to these London
merchants. (<i>Laughter.</i>) But I know not if any
son of New England, oppressed by exorbitant interest,
will be consoled by the thought that the Pilgrims paid
the same.</p>

<p>And yet this small people,&mdash;so obscure and outcast
in condition,&mdash;so slender in numbers and in means,&mdash;so
entirely unknown to the proud and great,&mdash;so absolutely
without name in contemporary records,&mdash;whose
departure from the Old World took little more than the
breath of their bodies,&mdash;are now illustrious beyond the
lot of men; and the Mayflower is immortal beyond the
Grecian Argo, or the stately ship of any victorious admiral.
Though this was little foreseen in their day, it is
plain now how it has come to pass. The highest greatness,
surviving time and storm, is that which proceeds
from the soul of man. (<i>Applause.</i>) Monarchs and cabinets,
generals and admirals, with the pomp of courts
and the circumstance of war, in the gradual lapse of
time disappear from sight; but the pioneers of Truth,
though poor and lowly, especially those whose example
elevates human nature and teaches the rights of man, so
that Government of the people, by the people, and for the
people shall not perish from the earth (<i>great applause</i>),&mdash;such
harbingers can never be forgotten, and their renown
spreads coëxtensive with the cause they served.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>I know not if any whom I now have the honor of addressing
have thought to recall the great in rank and
power filling the gaze of the world as the Mayflower
with her company fared forth on their venturous voyage.
The foolish James was yet on the English throne, glorying
that he had “soundly peppered off the Puritans.”<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
The morose Louis the Thirteenth, through whom Richelieu
ruled, was King of France. The imbecile Philip the
Third swayed Spain and the Indies. The persecuting
Ferdinand the Second, tormentor of Protestants, was
Emperor of Germany. Paul the Fifth, of the House
of Borghese, was Pope of Rome. In the same princely
company, and all contemporaries, were Christian the
Fourth, King of Denmark, and his son Christian, Prince
of Norway; Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden; Sigismund
the Third, King of Poland; Frederick, King of
Bohemia, with his wife, the unhappy Elizabeth of England,
progenitor of the House of Hanover; George William,
Margrave of Brandenburg, and ancestor of the
Prussian house that has given an emperor to Germany;
Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria; Maurice, Landgrave of
Hesse; Christian, Duke of Brunswick and Luneburg;
John Frederick, Duke of Würtemberg and Teck; John,
Count of Nassau; Henry, Duke of Lorraine; Albert,
Archduke of Austria, and his wife Isabella, Infanta of
Spain, joint rulers of the Low Countries; Maurice,
fourth Prince of Orange, of the House of Nassau;
Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy, and ancestor of the
King of United Italy; Cosmo de’ Medici, fourth Grand
Duke of Tuscany; Antonio Priuli, ninety-fifth Doge of
Venice, just after the terrible tragedy commemorated
on the English stage as “Venice Preserved”; Bethlen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Gabor, Prince of Unitarian Transylvania, and elected
King of Hungary with the countenance of an African;
and the Sultan Osman the Second, of Constantinople,
eighteenth ruler of the Turks.</p>

<p>Such at that time were the crowned sovereigns of
Europe, whose names were mentioned always with awe,
and whose countenances are handed down by Art, so
that at this day they are visible to the curious as if they
walked these streets. Mark now the contrast. There
was no artist for our forefathers, nor are their countenances
now known to men; but more than any powerful
contemporaries at whose tread the earth trembled
is their memory sacred. (<i>Applause.</i>) Pope, emperor,
king, sultan, grand-duke, duke, doge, margrave, landgrave,
count,&mdash;what are they all by the side of the
humble company that landed on Plymouth Rock?
Theirs, indeed, were the ensigns of worldly power;
but our Pilgrims had in themselves that inborn virtue
which was more than all else besides, and their
landing was an epoch.</p>

<p>Who in the imposing troop of worldly grandeur is
now remembered but with indifference or contempt?
If I except Gustavus Adolphus, it is because he revealed
a superior character. Confront the Mayflower and the
Pilgrims with the potentates who occupied such space
in the world. The former are ascending into the firmament,
there to shine forever, while the latter have been
long dropping into the darkness of oblivion, to be
brought forth only to point a moral or to illustrate the
fame of contemporaries whom they regarded not. (<i>Applause.</i>)
Do I err in supposing this an illustration of
the supremacy which belongs to the triumphs of the
moral nature? At first impeded or postponed, they at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
last prevail. Theirs is a brightness which, breaking
through all clouds, will shine forth with ever-increasing
splendor.</p>

<p>I have often thought, that if I were a preacher, if I
had the honor to occupy the pulpit so grandly filled
by my friend near me, (<i>gracefully inclining toward Mr.
Beecher</i>,) one of my sermons should be from the text,
“A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Nor do
I know a better illustration of these words than the
influence exerted by our Pilgrims. That small band,
with the lesson of self-sacrifice, of just and equal laws,
of the government of a majority, of unshrinking loyalty
to principle, is now leavening this whole continent,
and in the fulness of time will leaven the world.
(<i>Great applause.</i>) By their example republican institutions
have been commended; and in proportion as
we imitate them will these institutions be assured.
(<i>Applause.</i>)</p>

<p>Liberty, which we so much covet, is not a solitary
plant. Always by its side is Justice. (<i>Applause.</i>) Yet
Justice is nothing but Right applied to human affairs.
Do not forget, I entreat you, that with the highest
morality is the highest liberty. A great poet, in one
of his inspired sonnets, speaking of this priceless possession,
has said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“For who loves that must first be wise and good.”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Therefore do the Pilgrims in their beautiful example
teach liberty, teach republican institutions,&mdash;as at an
earlier day Socrates and Plato, in their lessons of wisdom,
taught liberty and helped the idea of the republic.
If republican government has thus far failed in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
experiment, as, perhaps, somewhere in Spanish America,
it is because these lessons have been wanting; there
have been no Pilgrims to teach the Moral Law.</p>

<p>Mr. President, with these thoughts, which I imperfectly
express, I confess my obligations to the forefathers
of New England, and offer to them the homage
of a grateful heart. But not in thanksgiving only
would I celebrate their memory. I would, if I could,
make their example a universal lesson, and stamp it
upon the land. (<i>Applause.</i>) The conscience which
directed them should be the guide for our public councils;
the just and equal laws which they required
should be ordained by us; and the hospitality to Truth
which was their rule should be ours. Nor would I forget
their courage and steadfastness. Had they turned
back or wavered, I know not what would have been the
record of this continent, but I see clearly that a great
example would have been lost. (<i>Applause.</i>) Had Columbus
yielded to his mutinous crew and returned to
Spain without his great discovery, had Washington
shrunk away disheartened by British power and the
snows of New Jersey, these great instances would have
been wanting for the encouragement of men. But our
Pilgrims belong to the same heroic company, and their
example is not less precious. (<i>Applause.</i>)</p>

<p>Only a short time after the landing on Plymouth
Rock, the great republican poet, John Milton, wrote
his “Comus,” so wonderful for beauty and truth. His
nature was more refined than that of the Pilgrims; and
yet it requires little effort of imagination to catch from
one of them, or at least from their beloved pastor, the
exquisite, almost angelic words at the close:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="SUPPLEMENTARY_CIVIL-RIGHTS_BILL" id="SUPPLEMENTARY_CIVIL-RIGHTS_BILL"></a>SUPPLEMENTARY CIVIL-RIGHTS BILL:
THE LAST APPEAL.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, January 27, 1874.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Supplementary Civil-Rights Bill, introduced by Mr. Sumner on
the first day of the Session, having now come up for consideration, and
the question being on a motion by Mr. Ferry, of Connecticut, to refer
it to the Committee on the Judiciary, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;There is a very good reason,
a very strong reason, why this bill should not be
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and it is
found in the history of the bill. I have in my hand a
memorandum, which has been kindly prepared for me
at the desk, disclosing details which Senators ought
to bear in mind before they vote. By the Journals of
the Senate it appears that as long ago as May 13,
1870,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained,
leave to bring in a bill supplementary to an Act entitled ‘An
Act to protect all persons in the United States in their civil
rights, and furnish the means of their vindication,’ passed
April 9, 1866; which was read the first and second times, by
unanimous consent, referred to the Committee on the Judiciary,
and ordered to be printed.”</p>

</div>

<p>The next appearance of the bill is July 7th, of that
year, when, according to the Journal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> “Mr. Trumbull,
from the Committee on the Judiciary,” with a large
number of other bills reported this to the Senate, with
a recommendation “that they ought not to pass.” The
record says that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Senate proceeded to consider the said bills as in
Committee of the Whole; and no amendment being made,
they were severally reported to the Senate.</p>

<p>“On motion by Mr. Trumbull,</p>

<p>“<i>Ordered</i>, That the said bills be postponed indefinitely.”</p>

</div>

<p>You will observe, Sir, the bill was treated in the
lump with others, at the close of the session; and you
have here the report of the very committee to which it
is now proposed to refer it.</p>

<p>The next appearance of the bill is January 20, 1871,
and the entry is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained,
leave to bring in a bill supplementary to an Act entitled ‘An
Act to protect all persons in the United States in their civil
rights, and furnish the means of their vindication,’ passed
April 9, 1866; which was read the first and second times, by
unanimous consent, referred to the Committee on the Judiciary,
and ordered to be printed.”</p>

</div>

<p>February 15, 1871, “Mr. Trumbull, from the Committee
on the Judiciary, to whom were referred the following
bills [the present with others], reported them
severally without amendment, and that they ought not
to pass.”</p>

<p>There was no action of the Senate at the time; for
you will bear in mind the lateness of the day in the
session; and Senators cannot have forgotten the pressure
of business at that time. That was sufficient reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
against the consideration of the bill. Indeed, with all
the assiduity that I could command, I was not able to
obtain a hearing for it.</p>

<p>Then came the first session of the Forty-Second Congress,
beginning March 4, 1871. Upon the Journal it
appears, March 9, 1871,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained,
leave to bring in [this same bill, with one other], which
were read the first and second times, by unanimous consent,
and ordered to lie on the table and be printed.”</p>

</div>

<p>In introducing the bill this third time I stated that
it had already been to the Judiciary Committee twice
before; that it was to be presumed that they had carefully
considered it; that they had reported it adversely;
that they had not reported any amendment; that I did
not think it advisable now to refer the bill to a committee
which had twice recorded an adverse judgment;
that the bill was well known to Senators; that it had
been before the Senate a long time; and that under the
circumstances I thought I should be justified in asking
that it take its place on the Calendar and be printed.
The order was made, and it held its place on the
Calendar.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward a measure of general amnesty, it
will be remembered, passed the House of Representatives
and came to this Chamber. Then it was that I
deemed it my duty to move this bill as an amendment,
and you will remember the extended discussion that ensued,&mdash;how
justice to the African race was contrasted
with generosity to those who had struck at the life of
the Republic, and it was insisted that our first duty was
justice. The debate was protracted. Senators cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
have forgotten it; and more than once votes were had
upon the pending amendment. I think it was twice
carried by the casting vote of the Vice-President. Certainly
it was attached to the bill for general amnesty,
and the debate reached over weeks, during which time
the Supplementary Civil-Rights Bill, as it came to be
called, underwent amendment. It was modified in various
particulars,&mdash;in none of great importance, in none
of principle, but verbally; also in the penalties, and in
the machinery: but the bill now stands, in principle
and in substance, as it was when originally introduced.
So far as it is changed, it is a change reached by debate
in this Chamber. The Senate itself has been a Committee
of the Whole sitting on this bill, superseding
thereby the labors of any special committee.</p>

<p>Why, then, after two references to the Judiciary Committee
should we have a third? Is it for delay? Is it
in the hope of any light on this important subject which
Senators have not already? Why, then, the reference?
I can see no considerable or sufficient object, except one
that we are compelled to recognize in this Chamber: can
it be a mode of opposition by interposing time, delay?</p>

<p>Now, Sir, the bill is on the Calendar No. 1. It should
have been the first acted upon this session; and if it
was not acted upon first, there is no blame on me, for I
tried to have you act upon it on one of the earliest days of
this session, but I was resisted here by the Senator from
Connecticut [Mr. <span class="smcap">Ferry</span>], and the Senator from Maine
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrill</span>]; the Senator from Connecticut insisting,
then as now, that the bill should go to a committee.
Now, Sir, I appeal to the Senate to take this important
measure into its own hands at once and directly.</p>

<p>What is the use of a Committee? It is as eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
ears to the Senate. How often do we repeat that saying!
But who wants eyes and ears for the appreciation
of this measure? Its character is manifest; its justice
is confessed; it is in harmony with all that has been
done to carry out the great results of the war; it is in
harmony with the Declaration of Independence, and
with the grand history of the Republic; it is in harmony
with the Constitutional Amendments, and it is
indeed necessary in order to their full enjoyment. The
necessity is manifest every day in the outrages to which
the colored race are exposed, not only in travel and at
hotels, but still more in the children of their homes,
who are shut out from those schools where they ought
to receive practically, as well as by lesson, the great duty
of Equality. The bill is an urgent necessity. There
ought to be no delay. There should not be the postponement
of a Committee, for the Committee is unnecessary.
The Committee has already sat upon it once,
twice: why a third time?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the debate which ensued, Mr. Stewart, of Nevada, and Mr.
Edmunds, of Vermont (Chairman of the Judiciary Committee), among
others, participated, both urging the proposed reference, and the latter
in remarks replete with personality. Mr. Sumner responded as
follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from Nevada has made a speech which
is founded on oblivion of the past. The bill has been
examined by the Judiciary Committee, and twice reported
by them adversely without amendment.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> When was the last report?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> February 15, 1871.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> That was in the time of Trumbull.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator says, “That was in the
time of Trumbull.” But it was reported adversely by
the Judiciary Committee, of which my learned friend
was a distinguished member, I think. I cannot mistake;
he must have been on the Committee, a party to
its report; and there was from him no minority voice,
no opposition on this floor to the report of the Chairman.
He allowed the Chairman to speak for the Committee,
including himself.</p>

<p>But the Senator from Nevada, oblivious of this history,
insists upon another reference. He wishes to put
this bill through another dance. For what purpose?
He has read the existing statute to which this is supplementary,
and he thinks that the Committee ought to
consider the aptitude of this bill to carry out the declared
purpose. Why, Sir, I agree with him that such
aptitude ought to exist, but do not forget that the bill has
been before the Senate now nearly four years. Nearly
four years has this bill, substantially as at this moment,
been before the Senate, and twice before the Judiciary
Committee.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, let us ascend from words to things. Why
make another reference? Is it that it may find verbal
place on your record that this bill was duly referred and
duly reported? That is the only reason I can imagine;
for the bill in its substance is well known to every Senator,
and, I may add, is well known to every lawyer in
the country. It has been discussed here again and
again, day after day, and has been modified after discussion;
and you now have the result of all the discussion
and the modification. It is well known. It is
familiar to the country. It has received the approbation
of those who are most interested in it. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
prayed for by petitioners without number. It has been
commended at public meetings with an earnestness and
an enthusiasm almost without parallel.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> May I ask the Senator a question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> I should like to ask my friend, the Senator
from Massachusetts, (as he is now speaking of the character
of the bill, which I did not care to refer to particularly,)
where the jury is summoned, and a man should happen to be
convicted of murder or any other crime under the State law,
would it, or not, set aside the verdict?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator will pardon me. I had not
intended to touch this branch of the debate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> I merely wish to ask him what he understands
to be the character of the fourth section, supposing we
pass it just as it stands, and supposing a jury happens to be
summoned contrary to the provisions of the fourth section,
but in accordance with the law of the State.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The effect of the violation of the law in
that respect need not be considered. It is sufficient that this
section provides a penalty against those who violate the law;
such is its simple object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> Ah! but let me ask my friend, does it not
also provide what shall constitute a lawful jury?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well,&mdash;and should it not so provide?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> Very well,&mdash;but my question is, What
would be the effect upon the trial of an indictment found by
a grand jury not composed in conformity to this motion?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I will not presume to pronounce an
opinion on that question. It is sufficient for me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the section is clear and explicit in imposing a penalty
upon the party making the exclusion, and that is all the
bill proposes. The other consequences may be, will be,
for the determination of the courts. The question belongs
to them; I doubt if it belongs to us. But the bill
is open to amendment. Let the Senator move such as
he thinks the case requires: I shall welcome it.</p>

<p>When the Senator interrupted me I was about to address
myself to him; for I should not have risen this
time but for the remarks which he made. I know not,
Sir, why my position on this question should justify the
personalities which the Senator from Vermont considers
so essential to debate. I certainly made no allusion to
him, nor do I claim anything for myself. I am an
humble worker in this Chamber, and in this cause I
have been laborious for years; but not on that account
do I claim anything, nor do I make any pretence. I
know not why the Senator should, with personality of
manner and allusion, undertake to taunt me for the
position that I occupy. Do I deserve it? I represent
humbly the sentiments of the people of Massachusetts,
who have sent me here now for many years. Always
loyal to these sentiments I hope to be, even though it
brings upon me the displeasure of the Senator. Sir, I
am anxious to harmonize with that Senator. I know,
too, his loyalty to this cause,&mdash;I do not doubt it; but
I now appeal to that Senator to unite with me in speeding
this great measure. Let him join sincerely, with
his large intelligence, to hasten this bill before the Senate
and make it the law of the land; so would he become
a benefactor to a much-oppressed people.</p>

<p>Possibly he has his doubts in regard to the Jury provision.
I know other lawyers have expressed doubts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
before; and from the inquiry that he made a moment
ago it is perhaps fair to infer that those doubts haunt
his mind. To that I simply answer, Happily they do
not haunt mine. I know the Constitution of my country,
and I know that under that Constitution, unless my
judgment fails entirely, the provision with reference to
juries is absolutely valid and constitutional. I challenge
the discussion. Let the Senator make his objections.
The original Civil-Rights Bill, which passed over the
veto of the President, solemnly declares that no evidence
shall be excluded from any court of justice, National
or State, on account of color. The nation has undertaken
to regulate the testimony, not only in its own
Courts but in State Courts; and will any one pretend
that it may not regulate the jury in State Courts,
when it may regulate the testimony in State Courts?
Why, Sir, there is nothing in the Constitution touching
testimony, but there are no less than three distinct provisions
relating to trial by jury; and among other terms
employed is “an impartial jury,” which is among the
privileges and immunities of the citizen. And is it
wrong for Congress, in the plenitude of its powers,
anxious to do justice to all, to declare that there shall
be an impartial jury in all tribunals, whether National
or State, without regard to color? Having begun by
regulating the testimony, where is the argument which
is to prevent us from regulating the jury? I need not
remind my excellent friend that originally the witnesses
and the jury were almost one and the same.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> They were precisely the same.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well,&mdash;so much the better; and
the Senator knows that there is a phrase handed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
to us from English courts by which we are reminded
constantly of the “witness-box” and the “jury-box.”
So closely were they together that they come under a
common nomenclature. Now I insist that they shall
come under a common safeguard. We have already
provided that there shall be no exclusion in testimony
on account of color: we must also provide that there
shall be no exclusion from the jury on account of color;
and until that provision is made by supreme national
law, not to be set aside, justice is not fully done.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I had no intention to discuss the character
of this bill; and I have only been led into it by the allusion
of the Senator, who, holding the bill in his hand,
signalizes that section as open to criticism. Let him
proceed with his criticism. But then I hope for better
things. I hope my friend, instead of criticism, will give
us that generous support which so well becomes him.
He sees full well, that, until this great question is completely
settled, the results of the war are not all secured,
nor is this delicate and sensitive subject banished from
these Halls. Sir, my desire, the darling desire, if I may
say so, of my soul, at this moment, is to close forever
this great question, so that it shall never again intrude
into these Chambers,&mdash;so that hereafter in all our legislation
there shall be no such words as “black” or
“white,” but that we shall speak only of citizens and of
men. Is not that an aspiration worthy of a Senator?
Is such an aspiration any ground for taunt from the
Senator of Vermont? Will he not, too, join in the aspiration
and the endeavor to bring about that beneficent
triumph? Let this be omitted now, let any part of this
bill be dropped out now, and you leave the question for
another Congress, to be pursued by other petitions, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
be pressed by other Senators and Representatives; for,
so long as injustice remains without redress, so long will
there be men to petition, and so long, I trust, will there
be Senators and Representatives to demand a remedy.
I ask for all now.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>At length, on the representation of Mr. Frelinghuysen, of New
Jersey, that, “by acquiescing with the other friends of the measure in
its reference to the Committee on the Judiciary, the Senator from Massachusetts
has it in his power to take from every opponent of the bill
any apology, reason, or excuse for opposing it,” followed by the declaration,
“I think we can give the Senator the assurance that a fortnight
will not pass without the bill being reported,”&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner inquiring,&mdash;“The Senator is a member of the Judiciary
Committee, I believe?”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Frelinghuysen.</span> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I accept his assurance and consent to the reference.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Edmunds, Chairman of the Committee, demurring to the proposed
agreement to report the bill within two weeks, suggested as a
substitute, “its consideration with the promptness that the business of
the Committee will allow,” which Mr. Frelinghuysen pronouncing
“equally satisfactory,” it was tacitly so settled,&mdash;Mr. Howe, of Wisconsin,
thereupon observing, “I think the assurances we have from
the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Vermont are a sufficient
guaranty that the bill will get back here in good season.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> And in good condition. (<i>Laughter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> Much better than it is now. (<i>Laughter.</i>)</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Morton of Indiana subsequently remarking,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I do not myself feel that there is any great importance in referring this
bill to a committee, for the reason that the question has been so long before
the Senate and has been so amply discussed. But still that is the usage of
the Senate; we do that with regard to all bills unless under some very
strong emergency; and if the Senator had consented in the first place to the
reference of the bill, we should have had it back long ago. So, I think, he
has nobody to blame but himself that this bill is not now before the Senate
to be acted upon. But I may be allowed to express the hope, and I have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
reason to doubt that it will be gratified, that the Judiciary Committee will
promptly examine this bill, and report back a Civil-Rights Bill upon which
the Senate can take action before long. I think that ought to be done for
very many considerations,&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I should not say another word, except
for the ardor with which my friend from Indiana comes
forward to throw a little blame on me. He thinks, that,
if I had consented to an earlier reference of this bill, it
would now be in order before the Senate; but he says
that in a case of strong emergency bills are not referred
to committees. Now I ask the Senator from Indiana if
this is not a case of strong emergency? The bill has
been pending nearly four solid years, during all which
time a portion of our fellow-citizens, counted by the
million, have been exposed to indignity; and because I
tried to speed the result, hoping to bring the Senate to a
generous conclusion of the whole measure without a reference
to the Committee, the Senator from Indiana thus
tardily seeks to rebuke me. If I erred at all, it was because
I trusted the Senate. I felt, that, with this bill on
the Calendar and within reach, it could not hesitate. I
was unwilling to see the bill in a committee-room, where
the Senate, in a generous moment, could not take it up
any day, and, so far as the Senate was concerned, make
it the law of the land. I put too much faith in this
body, which I ought to know well. I did, Sir, have
generous trust. I did believe that at some early day
the bill would be considered and adopted. I have been
disappointed. More than once I have tried to reach
it, I have tried to bring it before the Senate; but you
know well the impediments; you know that other important
matters have occupied attention, so that I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
not, with any reasonable chance of success, seek to press
this important measure. That, Sir, is the occasion for
delay; and I do not think&mdash;I hardly like to make any
question with my friend&mdash;but I do not think he was
generous in the imputation that he sought to throw
upon me. Had that Senator, on the first day of the
session, or when I made an effort at a later day to bring
it up, come forward then to aid me in pressing it on the
attention of the Senate,&mdash;had he reminded the Senate
and the country how many fellow-citizens were shut out
from their rights, and that a denial of rights does not
allow delay,&mdash;had these words come from the Senator
at that time, ah! we should have been having no such
debate as has occurred to-day. The bill would have
been hastened on its way, and a people long enslaved
and degraded would be at last lifted to equality.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The question being now put, the bill was referred to the Committee
on the Judiciary without objection.</p>

<p>March 11, 1874, Mr. Sumner died.</p>

<p>April 14th his bill was reported back by Mr. Frelinghuysen from
the Committee with an amendment in the form of a substitute,&mdash;being
substantially the original bill taken into a new draught, with a few differences
of machinery. In this form, after long and exhaustive debate,
it was passed in the Senate, May 22d, by Yeas 29, Nays 16.</p>

<p>In the House, all efforts to take it up were frustrated by the minority,
under the rule requiring a two-thirds vote for this purpose, until
the closing hours of the succeeding session, March 3, 1875, when a vote
was obtained referring it to the Committee on the Judiciary, but too
late for action, and the bill fell with the expiration of the Congress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, February 3d, Mr. Butler, of Massachusetts,
had reported a bill from this Committee, covering the provisions of the
Senate bill, with the exception only of that relating to cemeteries, but
with the addition to that on Common Schools of the proviso,&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That if any State or the proper authorities in any State, having the
control of Common Schools or other public institutions of learning aforesaid,
shall establish and maintain separate schools and institutions giving
equal educational advantages in all respects for different classes of persons
entitled to attend such schools and institutions, such schools and institutions
shall be a sufficient compliance with the provisions of this section so
far as they relate to schools and institutions of learning.”</p>

</div>

<p>On proceeding to a vote, the next day, February 14th, the entire
clause, embracing Common Schools, public institutions of learning or
benevolence, and national agricultural colleges, together with this proviso,
was, on motion of Mr. Kellogg, of Connecticut, struck out by Ayes
123, Noes 48,&mdash;a call for the Yeas and Nays, which would have
brought out the names, being refused. A previous motion by Mr.
Cessna, of Pennsylvania, to substitute the full text of the Senate bill
for that of the House Committee, now recurring, was defeated by Yeas
114, Nays 148,&mdash;and the latter, amended as above stated, was then
passed by Yeas 162, Nays 100,&mdash;and subsequently, February 27th, in
the Senate also, by Yeas 38, Nays 26,&mdash;and March 1st received the
approval of the Executive.</p>

<p>This bill, entitled “An Act to protect all citizens in their civil and
legal rights,”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> has since stood on the statute book as a finality,&mdash;these
rights, in the terms of the statute, consisting of “the full and equal
enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges
of [1st] inns, [2d] public conveyances on land or water, [3d] theatres,
and other places of public amusement”; to which another section, rising
to a higher plane, adds the declaration [4th] “That no citizen possessing
all other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law shall
be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any court of the
United States, or of any State, on account of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude,”&mdash;with such security to the colored citizens of this
inestimable right as may be found in the provision that “any officer or
other person, charged with any duty in the selection or summoning of
jurors, who shall exclude or fail to summon any citizen for the cause
aforesaid, shall, on conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
and be fined <i>not more</i> than five thousand dollars.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
